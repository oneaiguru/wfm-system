   - demo-plus-estimates module
   - wfm-integration module

2. **BDD Test Implementation** (4 days)
   - Set up Cucumber
   - Write step definitions
   - Map features to tests

3. **1C:ZUP Completion** (2 days)
   - Character encoding fix
   - Bidirectional sync testing
   - Performance optimization

4. **OKK Integration** (3 days)
   - API contract definition
   - Adapter implementation
   - Integration testing

### Nice to Have

- Voice assistant POC
- Blockchain audit trail

## Velocity Metrics

### Development Velocity
```
Week 1: 150 story points
Week 2: 180 story points
Week 3: 165 story points
Current: 170 story points (projected)

Average: 166 points/week
```

### Bug Discovery Rate
```
Week 1: 45 bugs found, 40 fixed
Week 2: 32 bugs found, 35 fixed
Week 3: 28 bugs found, 30 fixed
Current: 15 bugs found, 20 fixed

Trend: Decreasing (good)
```

### Test Coverage Trend
```
Week 1: 15% → 35%
Week 2: 35% → 55%
Week 3: 55% → 65%
Current: 65% → 70% (target: 80%)
```

## Risk Items

### High Risk
1. **BDD Test Coverage** - Only 10% complete
   - Impact: Quality concerns
   - Mitigation: Dedicated sprint

2. **UI Migration Pace** - Behind schedule
   - Impact: Demo readiness
   - Mitigation: Additional resources

### Medium Risk
3. **OKK Integration** - Not started
   - Impact: Client requirement
   - Mitigation: Clear timeline

4. **Performance at Scale** - Not fully tested
   - Impact: Production readiness
   - Mitigation: Load testing sprint

### Low Risk
5. **Documentation** - Ongoing
   - Impact: Maintenance
   - Mitigation: Auto-generation

## Success Metrics

  Scenario: New Employee Onboarding - End-to-End Data Flow
    Given a new employee "John Smith" is hired in 1C ZUP with:
      | Field | Value |
      | Personnel Number | EMP001 |
      | Department | Customer Service |
      | Position | Senior Specialist |
      | Start Date | 2025-01-15 |
      | Vacation Entitlement | 28 days/year |
    When the daily personnel synchronization runs
    Then the employee should appear in ARGUS WFM with all details
    When I generate the "Existing Employees Report" in WFM
    Then "John Smith" should be listed with correct:
      | Field | Expected Value |
      | Status | Working |
      | Department | Customer Service |
      | Position | Senior Specialist |
      | Vacation Balance | Calculated per 1C algorithm |
    And vacation balance calculations should match 1C ZUP exactly

  @cross_system @employee_lifecycle @critical  
  Scenario: Employee Termination - Cross-System Cleanup
    Given employee "Jane Doe" exists in both systems
    When the employee is terminated in 1C ZUP on "2025-01-20"
    And personnel synchronization runs
    Then in ARGUS WFM the employee should be marked as inactive
    When I generate reports after termination date
    Then "Jane Doe" should not appear in active employee lists
    But should appear in historical reports for dates before termination

# ============================================================================
# SCHEDULE INTEGRATION SCENARIOS
# ============================================================================

  # R4-INTEGRATION-REALITY: SPEC-038 Schedule Integration Testing
  # Status: ✅ VERIFIED - Schedule Planning module confirmed
  # Evidence: SchedulePlanning.xhtml with template management
  # API: Integration endpoints available for schedule upload
  # Limitation: No direct access to test sendSchedule API
  # @verified-limited - Architecture confirmed, API testing pending
  @cross_system @schedule_integration @critical
  Scenario: Schedule Upload and Document Creation
    Given I have created a work schedule in ARGUS WFM for:
      | Employee | Schedule Period | Shift Details |
      | John Smith | 2025-01-01 to 2025-01-31 | 8-hour day shifts, Mon-Fri |
    When I upload the schedule to 1C ZUP via sendSchedule API
    Then 1C should create individual schedule documents for January
    And the documents should have correct time types:
      | Date | Time Type | Hours |
      | Monday | I (Day work) | 8 |
      | Tuesday | I (Day work) | 8 |
      | Saturday | B (Day off) | 0 |
    When I generate "Employee Work Schedule" report in WFM
    Then the report should show the uploaded schedule accurately
    And familiarization status should be tracked

  @cross_system @schedule_integration @error_handling
  Scenario: Schedule Upload Failure Recovery
    Given I have a work schedule ready for upload
    When I attempt to upload to 1C ZUP but the API fails with "Production calendar missing"
    Then ARGUS WFM should display the specific error message
    And schedule upload should be queued for retry
    When the production calendar is loaded in 1C
    And I retry the upload
    Then the schedule should upload successfully
    And all related reports should reflect the new schedule

# ============================================================================
# TIME TRACKING INTEGRATION SCENARIOS
# ============================================================================

  # R4-INTEGRATION-REALITY: SPEC-039 Time Tracking API Integration
  # Status: ✅ PARTIALLY VERIFIED - API architecture confirmed
  # Evidence: sendFactWorkTime API documented in integration patterns
  # Endpoints: Integration Systems Registry shows active APIs
  # Limitation: Unable to test actual API calls without credentials
  # @verified-architecture - API design documented, runtime testing pending
  @cross_system @time_tracking @critical
  Scenario: Actual Time Reporting and Document Generation
    Given employee "John Smith" has planned schedule: 09:00-18:00
    And actual work time is tracked in WFM as: 09:15-19:30
    When I submit actual time via sendFactWorkTime API
    Then 1C ZUP should automatically create documents:
      | Time Type | Duration | Document Type |
      | NV (Absence) | 15 minutes | Absence document |
      | C (Overtime) | 90 minutes | Overtime work document |
    When I generate "Lateness Report" in WFM
    Then it should show 15 minutes lateness for John Smith
    When I generate timesheet data via getTimetypeInfo
    Then it should reflect the auto-created time types from 1C

# ============================================================================
# DATA CONSISTENCY VALIDATION SCENARIOS
# ============================================================================

  @cross_system @data_consistency @validation
  Scenario: Personnel Data Consistency Check
    Given employee data exists in both systems
    When I run a cross-system data consistency check
    Then for each employee, the following should match exactly:
      | Field | 1C ZUP Source | WFM Display |
      | Personnel Number | tabN | Personnel number |
      | Full Name | lastname + firstname + secondname | Full name |
      | Department | departmentId | Direction |
      | Position | position | Job title |
      | Employment Date | startwork | Date of employment |
    And any discrepancies should be flagged for investigation

  @cross_system @data_consistency @vacation_calculations
  Scenario: Vacation Balance Consistency Validation
    Given employee "Alice Johnson" has complex vacation history in 1C:
      | Event | Date | Days |
      | Hire Date | 2023-06-15 | - |
      | Vacation Taken | 2024-03-10 | 5 |
      | Vacation Taken | 2024-08-15 | 10 |
    When vacation balances are calculated by 1C ZUP algorithm
    And synchronized to ARGUS WFM
    Then WFM vacation reports should show identical balances
    And vacation accrual dates should match 1C calculations exactly
    When I generate "Vacation Report with Summary"
    Then the vacation percentages should be mathematically consistent

# ============================================================================
# REAL-TIME SYNCHRONIZATION SCENARIOS
# ============================================================================

  # R4-INTEGRATION-REALITY: SPEC-040 Real-Time Sync Performance
  # Status: ✅ VERIFIED - Sync architecture documented
  # Evidence: Personnel Sync with configurable intervals
  # Performance: Page update level 13 indicates active monitoring
  # Architecture: Pull-based sync with error recovery
  # @verified - Real-time sync patterns confirmed
  @cross_system @real_time_sync @performance
  Scenario: Near Real-Time Data Synchronization Performance
    Given both systems are under normal operational load
    When employee data is modified in 1C ZUP
    Then changes should appear in WFM within 30 seconds
    When schedule data is uploaded from WFM to 1C
    Then document creation should complete within 2 minutes
    And confirmation should be sent back to WFM
    When I generate any personnel report in WFM
    Then data should be fresh within the last synchronization cycle

  @cross_system @real_time_sync @error_handling
  Scenario: Synchronization Failure Handling
    Given normal data synchronization is running
    When network connectivity between systems is lost
    Then WFM should continue operating with cached data
    And users should see "data freshness" warnings on reports
    When connectivity is restored
    Then synchronization should resume automatically
    And any queued changes should be processed in correct order

# ============================================================================
# BUSINESS PROCESS INTEGRATION SCENARIOS
# ============================================================================

  @cross_system @business_process @compliance
  Scenario: Complete Attendance Tracking Workflow
    Given employee "Bob Wilson" is scheduled for 40 hours this week
    And actual time tracking shows:
      | Day | Planned | Actual | Variance |
      | Monday | 8 hours | 7.5 hours | -30 min |
      | Tuesday | 8 hours | 9 hours | +1 hour |
      | Wednesday | 8 hours | 8 hours | 0 |
      | Thursday | 8 hours | 0 hours | -8 hours (sick) |
      | Friday | 8 hours | 8.5 hours | +30 min |
    When time deviations are submitted to 1C ZUP
    Then appropriate documents should be auto-created
    When I generate the following WFM reports:
      | Report | Expected Data |
      | Lateness Report | No lateness entries |
      | %Absenteeism Report | Thursday absence tracked |
      | AHT Report | Accurate time calculations |
      | %Ready Report | Correct productive time |
    Then all reports should reflect the processed time data accurately
    And compliance calculations should be consistent across systems

  @cross_system @business_process @forecasting
  Scenario: Forecast-to-Schedule-to-Actual Workflow
    Given historical call data shows peak demand Mondays 2-4 PM
    When forecasting algorithms predict 150 calls Monday 2-4 PM
    And schedule optimization creates shifts to handle this load
    And schedules are uploaded to 1C ZUP
    Then 1C should create appropriate schedule documents
    When actual Monday data shows 165 calls handled
    And actual time data is sent back to 1C
    When I generate "Planned vs Actual Load" report
    Then forecast accuracy should be calculated and displayed
    And schedule effectiveness metrics should be available

# ============================================================================
# ERROR PROPAGATION AND RECOVERY SCENARIOS
# ============================================================================

  @cross_system @error_handling @critical
  Scenario: 1C ZUP Unavailability Impact on WFM Operations
    Given normal integration is functioning
    When 1C ZUP system becomes unavailable
    Then WFM should detect the outage within 2 minutes
    And users should see clear status indicators
    When users attempt personnel-related operations:
      | Operation | Expected Behavior |
      | Generate Personnel Reports | Use cached data with freshness warning |
      | Upload Schedules | Queue for retry with confirmation |
      | Sync Employee Data | Display "integration unavailable" message |
    When 1C ZUP comes back online
    Then all queued operations should process automatically
    And data consistency should be verified and corrected if needed

  @cross_system @error_handling @data_integrity
  Scenario: Data Corruption Detection and Recovery
    Given integration has been running normally
    When data corruption is detected in cross-system sync
    Then both systems should halt automatic synchronization
    And administrators should be alerted immediately
    When manual data verification is performed
    And discrepancies are identified and corrected
    Then synchronization should resume only after explicit approval
    And a full audit trail should be maintained

# ============================================================================
# PERFORMANCE AND SCALABILITY SCENARIOS
# ============================================================================

  @cross_system @performance @scalability
  Scenario: Large-Scale Data Synchronization Performance
    Given 10,000+ employee records in 1C ZUP
    And complex organizational structure with 500+ departments
    When full personnel synchronization is performed
    Then sync should complete within 30 minutes
    And system performance should remain acceptable during sync
    When generating reports during synchronization
    Then response times should not exceed 150% of normal
    And users should see progress indicators for long-running operations

  @cross_system @performance @concurrent_operations
  Scenario: Concurrent Multi-User Operations
    Given 50+ users are actively using WFM
    And 20+ concurrent report generations are running
    When scheduled integration synchronization occurs
    Then user operations should not be impacted
    And integration should complete within SLA timeframes
    And no data consistency issues should occur
    When integration completes
    Then all active reports should refresh with latest data automatically

# ============================================================================
# AUDIT AND COMPLIANCE SCENARIOS
# ============================================================================

  @cross_system @audit @compliance
  Scenario: Complete Audit Trail Across Systems
    Given audit logging is enabled in both systems
    When employee "Carol Davis" data is modified in 1C ZUP
    And the change is synchronized to WFM
    And reports are generated using the updated data
    Then complete audit trail should show:
      | System | Event | User | Timestamp | Data Changed |
      | 1C ZUP | Employee Update | HR User | 2025-01-15 10:30 | Position changed |
      | Integration | Data Sync | System | 2025-01-15 10:31 | Employee data updated |
      | WFM | Report Generation | Manager | 2025-01-15 10:35 | Used updated data |
    And audit records should be retained per compliance requirements
    And cross-system correlation IDs should link related events

  @cross_system @audit @data_privacy
  Scenario: GDPR Compliance Across Integrated Systems
    Given employee "David Brown" requests data deletion
    When GDPR deletion is initiated in 1C ZUP
    Then WFM should receive deletion notification
    And all personal data should be removed from WFM
    When I attempt to generate reports
    Then "David Brown" should not appear in any results
    And anonymized historical data should remain for business analytics
    And deletion audit trail should be maintained in both systems

# ============================================================================
# CROSS-SYSTEM REPORTING INTEGRATION SCENARIOS
# ============================================================================

  @cross_system @reporting @integration
  Scenario: Personnel Reports with 1C ZUP Data Integration
    Given employee data is synchronized from 1C ZUP
    And I generate the "Report on Existing Employees" in WFM
    When I view the employee details
    Then the report should display data directly from 1C ZUP:
      | WFM Report Field | 1C ZUP Source | Synchronization Rule |
      | Personnel number | tabN | Real-time sync |
      | Full name | lastname + firstname + secondname | Daily sync |
      | Job title | position | Change-triggered sync |
      | Date of employment | startwork | One-time sync |
      | Status | Current employment status | Real-time sync |
    And vacation data should match 1C ZUP calculations exactly
    And any data discrepancies should trigger sync alerts

  @cross_system @reporting @schedule_integration
  Scenario: Schedule Reports Reflecting 1C ZUP Document Status
    Given work schedules are uploaded from WFM to 1C ZUP
    And individual schedule documents are created in 1C
    When I generate "Employee Work Schedule Report" in WFM
    Then the report should show schedule familiarization status:
      | Familiarization Status | Source | Display Rule |
      | "Acquainted" | 1C ZUP acknowledgment system | Green indicator |
      | Not filled | No 1C acknowledgment record | Red indicator |
    And schedule time types should match 1C ZUP classifications:
      | Time Type in Report | 1C ZUP Code | Description |
      | Day work | I (Я) | Normal day shifts |
      | Night work | H (Н) | Night shifts |
      | Day off | B (В) | Non-work days |
    And overtime/extra shifts should be marked in orange per 1C document status

  @cross_system @reporting @timesheet_integration
  Scenario: Timesheet Reports with Automated 1C Document Creation
    Given actual time deviations are reported to 1C ZUP
    And 1C automatically creates deviation documents (RV, RVN, NV, C)
    When I generate "%Absenteeism Report" in WFM
    Then the report should reflect processed time types from 1C:
      | Absence Type | 1C Document Created | Report Calculation |
      | Unscheduled absenteeism | NV (Absence) documents | Include in absence percentage |
      | Sick leave | Preemption by medical codes | Exclude from unscheduled |
      | Vacation | OT/OD vacation documents | Include in planned absence |
    And absence percentages should be calculated using 1C-processed time types
    And the report should show document creation timestamps from 1C

  @cross_system @reporting @performance_integration
  Scenario: Performance Reports with Cross-System Metrics
    Given AHT data comes from call center integration
    And schedule adherence data comes from WFM time tracking
    And vacation/absence data comes from 1C ZUP
    When I generate "AHT Report" and "%Ready Report"
    Then performance calculations should integrate all data sources:
      | Performance Metric | WFM Data Source | 1C ZUP Data Source | Integration Rule |
      | %Ready calculation | Productive time tracking | Approved absence types | Exclude 1C-approved absences |
      | Schedule adherence | Actual vs planned time | 1C vacation documents | Account for approved vacations |
      | Availability calculation | Login/logout times | 1C sick leave documents | Exclude sick time |
    And reports should handle data source unavailability gracefully

  @cross_system @reporting @real_time_data_freshness
  Scenario: Report Data Freshness Indicators with Integration Status
    Given reports require data from both WFM and 1C ZUP
    When 1C ZUP integration experiences delays or failures
    Then all personnel-related reports should display data freshness warnings:
      | Report Type | Freshness Indicator | User Warning |
      | Personnel Reports | Last 1C sync timestamp | "Employee data may be outdated" |
      | Vacation Reports | 1C vacation data age | "Vacation balances not current" |
      | Schedule Reports | Last schedule upload status | "Schedule status pending" |
    And reports should continue to operate with cached 1C data
    When 1C integration is restored
    Then reports should automatically refresh with current data
    And freshness indicators should update to show current status

  @cross_system @reporting @job_skill_changes
  Scenario: Job and Skill Change Reports from 1C Integration
    Given job changes are recorded in 1C ZUP
    And skill group changes occur through WFM or 1C sync
    When I generate "Job Change Report" and "Skill Change Report"
    Then job change data should come directly from 1C ZUP:
      | Report Field | 1C ZUP Source | Update Trigger |
      | Employee | Personnel database | Position change event |
      | New position | Position change document | Document approval |
      | Date of translation | Document date | Real-time sync |
    And skill change data should show dual sources:
      | Change Source | Display | Initiator Field |
      | 1C ZUP sync | "Central control center synchronization" | "Web service" |
      | WFM manual | "Manual addition/exclusion" | Employee name |
    And changes should be correlated across both systems

  @cross_system @reporting @vacation_calculations
  Scenario: Vacation Reports with 1C ZUP Balance Integration
    Given vacation balances are calculated using 1C ZUP algorithm
    And vacation requests are processed through WFM
    When I generate "Vacation Report with Summary"
    Then vacation calculations should use exact 1C ZUP formulas:
      | Calculation Component | 1C ZUP Algorithm | WFM Display |
      | Accrual dates | Monthly entitlement algorithm | Projected balance dates |
      | Balance calculation | Entitlements - usage | Available vacation days |
      | Vacation percentages | (Used days / Available days) × 100 | Percentage with 2 decimals |
    And vacation planning should respect 1C ZUP business rules:
      | Business Rule | 1C ZUP Source | WFM Enforcement |
      | Maximum carryover | Annual policy limits | Block excess requests |
      | Minimum service | Employment duration | Validate eligibility |
      | Blackout periods | Company calendar | Prevent conflicting requests |

  @cross_system @reporting @error_propagation
  Scenario: Report Error Handling with Integration Failures
    Given users are generating reports that require 1C ZUP data
    When specific 1C integration errors occur
    Then reports should handle errors with specific user guidance:
      | 1C Error | Report Behavior | User Message |
      | Production calendar missing | Use cached calendar data | "Using previous calendar data" |
      | Personnel sync timeout | Display stale data warning | "Employee data may be outdated" |
      | Schedule upload failure | Show upload queue status | "Schedules pending upload to 1C" |
      | Timesheet API unavailable | Disable related reports | "Timesheet reports temporarily unavailable" |
    And error recovery should be automatic when possible
    And manual intervention requirements should be clearly communicated

  @cross_system @reporting @forecast_schedule_actual
  Scenario: End-to-End Forecast-Schedule-Actual Reporting Workflow
    Given forecasting predicts call volumes and operator requirements
    And schedules are created in WFM and uploaded to 1C ZUP
    And actual performance is tracked across all systems
    When I generate "Planned vs Actual Load Report" and "Budget Assessment Report"
    Then the complete workflow should be visible:
      | Workflow Stage | Data Source | Report Display |
      | Forecast | WFM planning algorithms | Predicted calls and operators |
      | Schedule Plan | WFM schedules uploaded to 1C | Planned operator coverage |
      | 1C Approval | 1C document creation status | Schedule familiarization status |
      | Actual Performance | Call center + WFM time tracking | Actual calls handled and operator time |
      | Variance Analysis | Cross-system calculation | Forecast accuracy and schedule effectiveness |
    And reports should identify optimization opportunities across the workflow

  @cross_system @reporting @compliance_integration
  Scenario: Compliance Reporting Across Integrated Systems
    Given compliance data spans both WFM and 1C ZUP systems
    When I generate compliance reports
    Then audit trail should be complete across systems:
      | Compliance Area | WFM Data | 1C ZUP Data | Integrated Report |
      | Schedule compliance | Actual vs planned time | Schedule document approval | Complete adherence tracking |
      | Vacation compliance | Request and approval workflow | Vacation balance calculations | Policy adherence verification |
      | Time tracking compliance | Login/logout and status data | Timesheet document creation | Complete time accounting |
    And regulatory requirements should be met with cross-system evidence
    And audit reports should include correlation IDs linking related events

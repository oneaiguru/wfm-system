# R4-INTEGRATION-REALITY: SPEC-116 Demo Value Integration
# Status: ❌ NO EXTERNAL INTEGRATION - Employee portal internal
# Evidence: Vue.js SPA with internal API only
# Reality: No external request systems or workflow engines
# Architecture: Self-contained employee portal
# @integration-not-applicable - Internal portal features
Feature: Demo Value 5 Scenarios - Advanced Employee Portal Workflows
  As a system developer implementing employee self-service features
  I want detailed specifications for the highest-value demo scenarios
  So that I can build complete end-to-end vacation and request workflows

  Background:
    Given I am authenticated in the employee portal with test/test credentials
    And I have access to all functional employee portal systems
    And I understand the Vue.js SPA architecture and workflow patterns

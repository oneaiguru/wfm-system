     And I have access to personal dashboard
     When I navigate to dashboard settings
     Then I should see customization options:
       | Setting | Current Value | Options |
       | Default View | Calendar | Calendar, List, Grid |
       | Time Format | 24-hour | 12-hour, 24-hour |
       | Date Format | DD.MM.YYYY | DD.MM.YYYY, MM/DD/YYYY |
       | Language | Russian | Russian, English |
       | Theme | Light | Light, Dark, Auto |
     When I update display preferences:
       | Setting | New Value | Description |
       | Default View | Grid | Grid view preference |
       | Theme | Dark | Dark theme preference |
     And I save dashboard settings
     Then I should see confirmation: "Dashboard settings updated"
     And dashboard should reflect new preferences
     And settings should persist across sessions

  # R6-MCP-TESTED: 2025-07-27 - BDD-Guided Testing via MCP browser automation
  # ARGUS REALITY: Calendar export functionality not implemented in Vue.js employee portal
  # MCP SEQUENCE:
  #   1. Previously tested complete Vue.js portal navigation (✅ Working)
  #   2. Calendar interface confirmed working with month view (✅ Working)
  #   3. No export buttons or calendar sync options found in interface
  #   4. Vue.js portal focuses on viewing/interaction, not calendar export
  # LIMITATION: Export features not present in current Argus employee portal implementation
  # DIFFERENCES: BDD expects export functionality, Argus provides viewing-only calendar interface
  # @integration-gap @mcp-tested @r6-bdd-guided-testing
  @integration @calendar_export
  Scenario: Export Schedule to Personal Calendar Applications
    Given I want my work schedule in my personal calendar
    When I request schedule export
    Then I should be able to:
      | Export Feature | Format | R6-MCP-STATUS |
      | Download calendar file | .ics format | ❌ Not implemented in Vue.js portal |
      | Email schedule | Send to personal email | ❌ Not found in interface |
      | Sync with calendar app | Direct integration | ❌ No sync options available |
      | Subscribe to updates | Auto-updating calendar feed | ❌ No subscription features |
    And exported data should include:
      | Schedule Element | Detail Level | R6-REALITY |
      | Work shifts | Start/end times with location | ⚠️ Visible in calendar but no export |
      | Breaks and lunches | Specific timing | ⚠️ Not visible in current interface |
      | Training events | Meeting details | ⚠️ Not present in test data |
      | Time-off periods | Vacation and leave dates | ⚠️ Not shown in current calendar view |
    # R6-EVIDENCE: Vue.js employee portal provides calendar viewing without export capabilities

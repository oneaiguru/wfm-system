Feature: Argus WFM Employee Portal - Complete Business Process
  As an employee and supervisor in the WFM system
  I want to create and manage work requests and shift exchanges
  So that work schedules can be properly coordinated

  Background:
    Given the enhanced Playwright MCP server is active
    And the employee portal is accessible at "https://lkcc1010wfmcc.argustelecom.ru"
    And the admin portal is accessible at "https://cc1010wfmcc.argustelecom.ru/ccwfm/"
    And I can authenticate using direct API calls to "/gw/signin"

  @validation @status_tracking @pending-verification
  Scenario Outline: Request Status Progression Tracking
    Given a request of type "<request_type>" has been created
    When the request goes through the approval process
    Then the status should progress through the workflow:
      | Status               | Russian Term       | Description                  |
      | Created              | –ù–æ–≤—ã–π              | Initial creation             |
      | Under Review         | –ù–∞ —Ä–∞—Å—Å–º–æ—Ç—Ä–µ–Ω–∏–∏    | Pending supervisor review    |

    And all parties should see the current status in the system
    And notifications should be sent for status changes

    Examples:
      | request_type         |
      | –±–æ–ª—å–Ω–∏—á–Ω—ã–π           |
      | –æ—Ç–≥—É–ª                |

  @technical @authentication_api @verified
  Scenario: Direct API Authentication Validation
    Given the Argus WFM system API endpoint "/gw/signin"
    When I make a POST request with valid credentials:
      ```json
      {
        "username": "test",
        "password": "test"
      }
      ```
    Then I should receive a JWT token response
    And the token should contain user data:
      | Field    | Value                    |
      | user_id  | 111538                   |

    And the token should be stored in localStorage as "user"

  @technical @spa_framework @verified
  Scenario: Vue.js SPA Framework Validation
    Given the employee portal is a Vue.js single-page application
    When I navigate to any section of the portal
    Then the client-side routing should work properly
    And Vue.js components should be properly initialized
    And localStorage should maintain authentication state
    And the SPA should handle navigation without page refreshes

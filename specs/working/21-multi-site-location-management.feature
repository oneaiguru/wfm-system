Feature: Multi-Site Location Management with Database Schema
  As a system administrator managing multiple site locations
  I want to configure and manage distributed locations with comprehensive database support
  So that I can coordinate operations across geographically distributed sites

  Background:
    Given I have system administrator privileges
    And I can access multi-site management configuration
    And the system supports distributed location operations
    And database schemas support location hierarchy management

  @multi_site_management @location_hierarchy @database_schema
  Scenario: Configure Multi-Site Location Database Architecture
    # R4-INTEGRATION-REALITY: SPEC-024 Multi-Site Location Testing
    # Status: ✅ PARTIALLY VERIFIED - Timezone support confirmed
    # Evidence: Personnel Sync has timezone selection (Москва, Владивосток, Екатеринбург, Калининград)
    # Evidence: Employee management shows 513 employees across departments
    # Context: Multi-site implied by timezone support and department structure
    # @verified-limited - Basic location support via timezone/department structure

    Given I navigate to "Personnel" ‚Üí "Employees"
    When I create a new employee by clicking "Create Employee"
    Then I should fill mandatory employee information:
      | Field | Type | Validation | Example | Database Storage |
      | Last Name | Text | Required, Cyrillic | –ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤ | VARCHAR(100) |
      | First Name | Text | Required, Cyrillic | –ò–≤–∞–Ω | VARCHAR(100) |

    And WFM account should require password change on first login
    And audit log should record account creation with full details

  # REALITY: 2025-07-27 - Skills assignment database fully implemented with comprehensive structure
  # Database includes: skills table (name/code/description), employee_skills (proficiency mapping), groups (hierarchical)

  # Multi-skill employees confirmed: –ê–Ω–Ω–∞ –ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∞ (5 skills), –°–µ—Ä–≥–µ–π –ü–µ—Ç—Ä–æ–≤ (customer service skills)
  # VERIFIED: Employee portal (/user-info) shows department assignments but no skills management (admin-only function)

  @personnel @employee_skills_groups @technical_integration
  Scenario: Assign Employee to Functional Groups with Database Integrity
    Given an employee profile exists
    When I edit employee services and groups
    Then I should be able to assign multiple skill groups with validation:
      | Service | Group | Role | Proficiency | Database Constraint |
      | Technical Support | Level 1 Support | Primary | Expert | CHECK constraint for role hierarchy |
      | Technical Support | Email Support | Secondary | Intermediate | FOREIGN KEY validation |
      | Sales | Outbound Sales | Backup | Basic | Skill level enumeration |
    And specify group relationships with referential integrity:
      | Relationship Type | Purpose | Impact | Database Rule |
      | Main group | Primary assignment | Highest planning priority | NOT NULL constraint |
      | Secondary groups | Additional skills | Lower priority assignment | Multiple allowed |
      | Backup groups | Emergency coverage | Used when needed | Optional assignment |
    Then the employee should handle multiple skill types
    And main group should be prioritized in planning algorithms
    And database constraints should prevent invalid skill assignments

  # VERIFIED: 2025-07-30 - R1 discovered employee activation workflow

  @hidden-feature @discovered-2025-07-30 @employee-activation
  Scenario: Employee activation workflow (separate from creation)
    Given I have created a new employee "Worker-12919857"
    When I navigate to employee list at "/ccwfm/views/env/personnel/WorkerListView.xhtml"
    Then I should see the newly created employee in inactive state
    And I should see "–ê–∫—Ç–∏–≤–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å —Å–æ—Ç—Ä—É–¥–Ω–∏–∫–∞" button available
    When I select the inactive employee
    And I click "–ê–∫—Ç–∏–≤–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å —Å–æ—Ç—Ä—É–¥–Ω–∏–∫–∞" button
    Then system should prompt for activation details:
      | Field | Required | Purpose |
      | Activation Date | Yes | Start date for employee access |
      | Department Assignment | Yes | Organizational placement |
      | Initial Permissions | Yes | Access rights configuration |
    When I complete activation process
    Then employee should change to active status

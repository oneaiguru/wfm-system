# R4-INTEGRATION-REALITY: SPEC-117 Final Validation Integration
# Status: ❌ NO EXTERNAL INTEGRATION - Internal validation only
# Evidence: Testing scenarios use internal systems only
# Reality: No external testing frameworks or validation APIs
# Architecture: Self-contained testing within Argus
# @integration-not-applicable - Internal validation features
Feature: Final Validation Scenarios - Live System Testing
  As a system developer completing R2 employee portal testing
  I want to validate the remaining scenarios with live system testing
  So that I can achieve 100% coverage of employee self-service functionality

  Background:
    Given I have completed 45 out of 57 scenarios (79% coverage)
    And I have comprehensive documentation for all major workflows
    And I need to validate the remaining 12 scenarios with live testing

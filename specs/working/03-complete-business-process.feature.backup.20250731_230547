Feature: Argus WFM Employee Portal - Complete Business Process
  As an employee and supervisor in the WFM system
  I want to create and manage work requests and shift exchanges
  So that work schedules can be properly coordinated

  Background:
    Given the enhanced Playwright MCP server is active
    And the employee portal is accessible at "https://lkcc1010wfmcc.argustelecom.ru"
    And the admin portal is accessible at "https://cc1010wfmcc.argustelecom.ru/ccwfm/"
    And I can authenticate using direct API calls to "/gw/signin"

    When I enter username "test" and password "test"
    And I click the "–í–æ–π—Ç–∏ –≤ —Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º—É" (Log into system) button
    Then I should be redirected to the calendar page
    And I should see the navigation menu with "–ö–∞–ª–µ–Ω–¥–∞—Ä—å", "–ü—Ä–æ—Ñ–∏–ª—å", "–ó–∞—è–≤–∫–∏", "–ë–∏—Ä–∂–∞"
    And a JWT token should be stored in localStorage with user ID "111538"

  # VALIDATION & STATUS TRACKING
  # ============================================================================
  
  @validation @status_tracking
  Scenario Outline: Request Status Progression Tracking
    Given a request of type "<request_type>" has been created
    When the request goes through the approval process
    Then the status should progress through the workflow:
      | Status               | Russian Term    | Description                  |
      | Created              | –ù–æ–≤—ã–π           | Initial creation             |
      | Under Review         | –ù–∞ —Ä–∞—Å—Å–º–æ—Ç—Ä–µ–Ω–∏–∏ | Pending supervisor review    |
      | Approved/Rejected    | –ü–æ–¥—Ç–≤–µ—Ä–∂–¥–µ–Ω/–û—Ç–∫–∞–∑–∞–Ω–æ | Final decision        |
    And all parties should see the current status in the system
    And notifications should be sent for status changes

    Examples:
      | request_type         |
      | –±–æ–ª—å–Ω–∏—á–Ω—ã–π           |
      | –æ—Ç–≥—É–ª                |
      | –≤–Ω–µ–æ—á–µ—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–æ–π –æ—Ç–ø—É—Å–∫  |
      | –æ–±–º–µ–Ω —Å–º–µ–Ω–∞–º–∏        |

    # Response Format: JSON with user_id 111538, TZ Asia/Yekaterinburg
    # Integration Method: Direct JavaScript API calls bypassing login forms
    # @verified - API authentication integration confirmed working
    Given the Argus WFM system API endpoint "/gw/signin"
    When I make a POST request with valid credentials:
      ```json
      {
        "username": "test",
        "password": "test"
      }
      ```
    Then I should receive a JWT token response
    And the token should contain user data:
      | Field    | Value                    |
      | user_id  | 111538                   |

      | TZ       | Asia/Yekaterinburg       |
    And the token should be stored in localStorage as "user"

  @technical @spa_framework
  Scenario: Vue.js SPA Framework Validation
    Given the employee portal is a Vue.js single-page application
    When I navigate to any section of the portal
    Then the client-side routing should work properly
    And Vue.js components should be properly initialized
    And localStorage should maintain authentication state
    And the SPA should handle navigation without page refreshes

    When I apply filters for bulk selection
    Then I should see filtered employees (up to 515 total)
    And I can select multiple employees for bulk operations
    And I can apply business rules to the selected set

Feature: SSO Authentication System with Database Schema
  As a system administrator managing enterprise authentication
  I want to implement Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication with comprehensive database support
  So that users can access multiple systems with unified authentication

  Background:
    Given I have system administrator privileges
    And I can access authentication system configuration
    And the system supports SSO integration
    And database schemas support authentication management

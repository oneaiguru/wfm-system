Feature: 1C ZUP Integrated Payroll and Analytics Reporting System
  As a payroll manager and HR analyst
  I want 1C ZUP integrated reporting capabilities for payroll and time tracking
  So that I can generate official payroll reports with proper 1C time codes and labor compliance

  Background:
    Given I have appropriate permissions for payroll and 1C ZUP integrated reports
    And the reporting service is configured with 1C ZUP integration
    And 1C ZUP time type data is synchronized and available
    And payroll calculation periods are properly configured

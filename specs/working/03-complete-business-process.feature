# üéâ COMPLETE BUSINESS PROCESS BDD SPECIFICATIONS
# Based on Successful Argus WFM Employee Portal Access

Feature: Argus WFM Employee Portal - Complete Business Process
  As an employee and supervisor in the WFM system
  I want to create and manage work requests and shift exchanges
  So that work schedules can be properly coordinated

  Background:
    Given the enhanced Playwright MCP server is active
    And the employee portal is accessible at "https://lkcc1010wfmcc.argustelecom.ru"
    And I can authenticate using direct API calls to "/gw/signin"

  # ============================================================================
  # AUTHENTICATION & ACCESS - VERIFIED WORKING
  # ============================================================================
  
  @authentication @verified
  Scenario: Successful Employee Portal Authentication
    Given I navigate to "https://lkcc1010wfmcc.argustelecom.ru/login"
    When I execute JavaScript to call the signin API with:
      | username | test |
      | password | test |
    Then a JWT token should be stored in localStorage
    And I should see user data with ID "111538"
    And I should be redirected to the calendar page "/calendar"

  @navigation @verified  
  Scenario: Employee Portal Navigation Access
    Given I am authenticated in the employee portal
    When I examine the main navigation
    Then I should see the following menu options:
      | Menu Item     | URL       | Purpose                    |
      | –ö–∞–ª–µ–Ω–¥–∞—Ä—å     | /calendar | Calendar and schedule view |

    When I navigate to the "–ë–∏—Ä–∂–∞" (Exchange) section
    And I select the "–ú–æ–∏" (My) tab
    Then I should see my exchange request with columns:
      | Column      | Russian Term | Content                    |
      | Period      | –ü–µ—Ä–∏–æ–¥       | Date range of exchange     |

    And there are available shift exchange requests from other operators
    When I navigate to the "–ë–∏—Ä–∂–∞" (Exchange) section
    And I select the "–î–æ—Å—Ç—É–ø–Ω—ã–µ" (Available) tab
    And I see exchange offers in the list
    And I select an exchange request from another operator
    And I click "–ü—Ä–∏–Ω—è—Ç—å" (Accept) or equivalent action
    Then the request status should be updated
    And I should see the updated status in "–ú–æ–∏" (My) section
    And the system should show "–ü—Ä–µ–¥–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è, –Ω–∞ –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ –≤—ã –æ—Ç–∫–ª–∏–∫–Ω—É–ª–∏—Å—å" (Offers you responded to)

  # VALIDATION & STATUS TRACKING
  # ============================================================================
  
  @validation @status_tracking
  Scenario Outline: Request Status Progression Tracking
    Given a request of type "<request_type>" has been created
    When the request goes through the approval process
    Then the status should progress through the workflow:
      | Status               | Russian Term    | Description                  |
      | Created              | –ù–æ–≤—ã–π           | Initial creation             |
      | Under Review         | –ù–∞ —Ä–∞—Å—Å–º–æ—Ç—Ä–µ–Ω–∏–∏ | Pending supervisor review    |
      | Approved/Rejected    | –ü–æ–¥—Ç–≤–µ—Ä–∂–¥–µ–Ω/–û—Ç–∫–∞–∑–∞–Ω–æ | Final decision        |
    And all parties should see the current status in the system
    And notifications should be sent for status changes

    Examples:
      | request_type         |
      | –±–æ–ª—å–Ω–∏—á–Ω—ã–π           |
      | –æ—Ç–≥—É–ª                |
      | –≤–Ω–µ–æ—á–µ—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–æ–π –æ—Ç–ø—É—Å–∫  |

    # R4-INTEGRATION-REALITY: SPEC-009 API Integration Testing 2025-07-27
    # Status: ‚úÖ VERIFIED - Direct API authentication working
    # Endpoint: /gw/signin functional via JavaScript calls

    # Response Format: JSON with user_id 111538, TZ Asia/Yekaterinburg
    # Integration Method: Direct JavaScript API calls bypassing login forms
    # @verified - API authentication integration confirmed working
    Given the Argus WFM system API endpoint "/gw/signin"
    When I make a POST request with valid credentials:
      ```json
      {
        "username": "test",
        "password": "test"
      }
      ```
    Then I should receive a JWT token response
    And the token should contain user data:
      | Field    | Value                    |
      | user_id  | 111538                   |
      | username | test                     |
      | TZ       | Asia/Yekaterinburg       |
    And the token should be stored in localStorage as "user"

  @technical @spa_framework
  Scenario: Vue.js SPA Framework Validation
    Given the employee portal is a Vue.js single-page application
    When I navigate to any section of the portal
    Then the client-side routing should work properly
    And Vue.js components should be properly initialized
    And localStorage should maintain authentication state
    And the SPA should handle navigation without page refreshes

    When I apply filters for bulk selection
    Then I should see filtered employees (up to 515 total)
    And I can select multiple employees for bulk operations
    And I can apply business rules to the selected set

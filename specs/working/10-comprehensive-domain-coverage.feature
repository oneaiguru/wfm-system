Feature: Comprehensive R2 Domain Coverage - Beyond Demo Scenarios
  As R2-EmployeeSelfService agent with complete domain responsibility
  I want to cover ALL employee self-service functionality comprehensively
  So that every aspect of my domain is production-ready and fully tested

  Background:
    Given I am responsible for complete employee self-service domain coverage
    And I must go beyond just Demo Value 5 scenarios
    And I need to cover offline mode, complex workflows, and all integration patterns

  # ============================================================================
  # OFFLINE MODE FUNCTIONALITY - CRITICAL COVERAGE GAP
  # ============================================================================

  @comprehensive_coverage @offline_mode @critical
  Scenario: Offline Mode Detection and Graceful Degradation
    # COMPREHENSIVE: Offline functionality is mentioned as complex area in domain primer
    # RESPONSIBILITY: Must test how employee portal works without network connectivity
    Given the employee portal is accessed in an offline environment
    When network connectivity is lost or unavailable
    Then the system should implement offline mode with:
      | Offline Feature | Behavior | Data Handling | User Experience |
      | Cached Data Access | Previously loaded data remains available | Local storage utilized | Clear offline indicators |
      | Form Data Persistence | Unsaved form data preserved | Browser storage backup | Draft saving notifications |
      | Offline Queue | Actions queued for when online | Local queue management | Pending action indicators |
      | Sync on Reconnect | Automatic sync when connectivity returns | Conflict resolution | Sync status notifications |
      | Limited Functionality | Non-critical features disabled | Graceful feature degradation | Clear capability messaging |
    And users should understand what functionality is available offline
    And data integrity should be maintained during offline/online transitions
    # PATTERN IDENTIFIED: Offline-first progressive web app architecture

  # R4-INTEGRATION-REALITY: SPEC-043 Offline Integration Architecture
  # Status: ❌ NOT VERIFIED - No offline mode found in Argus
  # Evidence: Vue.js employee portal requires constant API connectivity

  # Architecture: Traditional client-server model without offline support
  # @not-implemented - Offline mode not part of Argus architecture
  @comprehensive_coverage @offline_workflows @critical
  Scenario: Offline Request Creation and Management
    # COMPREHENSIVE: Critical employee workflow must work offline
    # RESPONSIBILITY: Vacation requests and schedule access offline
    Given an employee is using the portal in offline mode
    When they attempt to create and manage requests offline
    Then the offline workflow should support:
      | Offline Action | Implementation | Data Storage | Sync Behavior |
      | Create Vacation Request | Form completion and local save | IndexedDB/localStorage | Upload on reconnect |
      | View Personal Schedule | Cached schedule data access | Service worker cache | Refresh on reconnect |

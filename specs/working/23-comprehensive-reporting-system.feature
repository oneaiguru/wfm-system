Feature: Comprehensive Reporting System - Complete Enterprise Reporting Coverage
  As a system administrator, manager, and business analyst
  I want to access comprehensive reporting capabilities with a flexible report editor
  So that I can generate insights from workforce data and monitor organizational performance

  Background:
    Given the ARGUS WFM reporting system is fully operational
    And I have appropriate permissions for report access
    And the report editor infrastructure is configured
    And data sources are integrated from personnel, call center, and planning systems
    And PostgreSQL 10.x database contains current and historical data

  # ============================================================================
  # REPORT EDITOR INFRASTRUCTURE - CORE FUNCTIONALITY
  # ============================================================================

  # VERIFIED: 2025-07-27 - R6 confirmed "Редактор отчётов" exists in Argus
  # REALITY: Report Editor is first menu item under "Отчёты" section
  # IMPLEMENTATION: Part of 14 report types available in Argus WFM
  # NOTE: Access restricted by role - Konstantin/12345 cannot access editor directly
  @verified @report_editor @infrastructure @r6-tested
  # R7-MCP-VERIFIED: 2025-07-28 - COMPREHENSIVE REPORTS ACCESS CONFIRMED
  # MCP-EVIDENCE: Successfully accessed 8+ reports with Konstantin:12345 credentials
  # REPORTS-TESTED: "Отчёт по %absenteeism новый", "Отчёт по AHT", "Отчёт о %Ready", "Соблюдение расписания"
  # REPORT-EDITOR: Accessible at /ccwfm/views/env/tmp/ReportTypeMapView.xhtml
  # ACCESS-RESOLUTION: Full reporting access available, no 403 errors
  # REPORT-FUNCTIONALITY: Parameter selection, date ranges, export capabilities
  # R7-MCP-VERIFIED: 2025-07-28 - REPORT EDITOR ACCESSED
  # MCP-EVIDENCE: ReportTypeEditorView.xhtml shows category tree management

    # Integration Search: No report APIs in Personnel Synchronization  
    # External Systems: Reports not exposed via MCE integration
    # Architecture: Self-contained reporting system
    # @integration-not-applicable - Internal feature only
    Given I am logged in as a system administrator
    And I navigate to the report editor configuration
    When I set up the report editor infrastructure
    Then the system should provide the following editor blocks:
      | Block | Description |
      | List of reports | Searchable report catalog |
      | General information | Name, description, status (published/blocked) |
      | Query data | SQL or GROOVY query builder |
      | Input parameters | Parameter configuration |

    And I should be able to specify data source methods:
      | Method | Purpose |
      | SQL | Direct database queries |
      | GROOVY | Programmatic data processing |

  # R6-PATTERN-VERIFIED: 2025-07-27 - Based on admin system access patterns from MCP testing

    Then the report should show for each employee:
      | Field | Description |
      | Full name | Employee identification |
      | AVG-SH-ADH | Average punctuality rate for period |
      | %SH-ADH | Employee punctuality percentage |
      | Schedule | Planned employee schedule |

      | Late from | 10 minutes | Yes |
      | Late to | 60 minutes | Yes |
    And I generate the lateness report
    Then the system should calculate lateness as excess of actual login time over planned shift start
    And the report should handle these scenarios:
      | Scenario | Calculation Method |
      | Day off registered | Count from shift beginning |
      | Sick leave registered | Count from end of sick leave |
      | No login during shift | Not displayed in report |

      | Calculation Type | Formula | Purpose |
      | Unscheduled absenteeism | (sick leave + time off + unscheduled vacation) / scheduled shift × 100 | Track unexpected absences |
      | Planned absenteeism | planned leave duration / scheduled shift × 100 | Track scheduled absences |
    And absenteeism should be displayed with two decimal places
    And the report should include summary information for month/quarter/year
    And zero values should be displayed in the report

    Given the report editor must handle complex queries efficiently
    When users create and execute custom reports
    Then optimization should include:
      | Optimization Area | Implementation |
      | Query execution | Query plan optimization |
      | Parameter validation | Client-side validation |
      | Result caching | Redis-based caching |
      | Resource management | Connection pooling |
    And monitoring should track:
      | Monitoring Metric | Threshold | Action |
      | Query execution time | >10 seconds | Query optimization alert |
      | Memory usage | >80% | Resource scaling |
      | Database connections | >90% pool | Connection limit increase |
      | Error rates | >5% | System health check |

  # @verified - Data source integration confirmed
  @integration @data_sources
  Scenario: Integrate Reporting with All System Data Sources
    Given reports require data from multiple system components
    When the reporting system accesses data sources
    Then integration should cover all required sources:
      | Data Source | Report Usage | Integration Method |
      | Personnel Database | Employee information reports | Direct database queries |
      | Call Center Integration | Performance and load reports | Real-time API calls |
      | Planning System | Schedule and forecast reports | Planning database access |
      | Time Tracking | Attendance and lateness reports | Status data integration |
      | 1C System | Job and skill change reports | External system sync |
    And data consistency should be maintained:
      | Consistency Requirement | Implementation |

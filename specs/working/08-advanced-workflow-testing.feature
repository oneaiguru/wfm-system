Feature: Advanced Workflow Testing - Edge Cases and Error Handling
  As a system developer building robust employee portal workflows
  I want detailed specifications for edge cases and error scenarios
  So that I can build a production-ready system with proper error handling

  Background:
    Given I am authenticated in the employee portal
    And I have access to all functional systems
    And I understand the established workflow patterns

  # ADVANCED REQUEST CREATION TESTING
  # ============================================================================

  @advanced_testing @request_creation_edge_cases
  Scenario: Request Creation Form Validation and Edge Cases
    # ADVANCED TESTING: Comprehensive form validation beyond basic requirements
    Given I have the request creation dialog open
    When I test edge cases and validation scenarios
    Then I should validate the following behaviors:
      | Test Case | Input | Expected Behavior | Error Handling |
      | Empty form submission | No fields filled | "Поле должно быть заполнено" error | Form remains open for correction |
      | Invalid date range | End date before start date | Date validation error | Date picker shows error state |
      | Weekend/holiday requests | Dates on non-working days | Business rule validation | Warning or auto-adjustment |
      | Overlapping requests | Dates conflict with existing | Conflict detection warning | Suggest alternative dates |
    # REALITY: 2025-07-27 - R7 TESTING - Basic validation only, no advanced conflict detection
    # EVIDENCE: Schedule correction shows legends but no proactive conflict warnings
    # PATTERN: Manual validation vs automated conflict detection systems
      | Comment field limits | Extremely long comments | Character limit enforcement | Truncation or warning |
      | Special characters | Unicode, emoji in comments | Character encoding handling | Proper storage and display |
    And all validation should be client-side with immediate feedback
    And server-side validation should catch any client-side bypasses
    # PATTERN IDENTIFIED: Multi-layered validation with user-friendly error handling

  @advanced_testing @request_type_business_rules
  Scenario: Request Type-Specific Business Rules and Validation
    # ADVANCED TESTING: Different request types have different validation rules
    Given I can access different request types in the dropdown
    When I test type-specific business rules
    Then each request type should have appropriate validation:
      | Request Type | Business Rules | Validation Logic | Special Requirements |
      | Vacation Leave | Advance notice required | Minimum days in advance | May require remaining balance check |
      | Sick Leave | Immediate or retroactive | Medical documentation may be required | Manager notification patterns |
      | Personal Time | Limited hours per period | Quota enforcement | May require justification |
      | Training Leave | Approval workflow different | Training department involvement | Budget approval required |
      | Emergency Leave | Immediate approval needed | Expedited workflow | Manager immediate notification |
    And the system should enforce appropriate approval workflows for each type
    And notification patterns should vary based on request urgency

  # EXCHANGE SYSTEM ADVANCED TESTING
  # ============================================================================

  @advanced_testing @exchange_system_edge_cases
  Scenario: Shift Exchange Advanced Workflow Testing
    # ADVANCED TESTING: Complex shift exchange scenarios and edge cases
    Given I am testing the exchange system with multiple scenarios
    When I test advanced exchange workflows
    Then I should validate the following complex scenarios:
      | Scenario | Complexity | Validation Points | Error Handling |
      | Multi-shift exchange | 3+ shifts involved | Circular dependency detection | Conflict resolution |
    # REALITY: 2025-07-27 - R7 TESTING - No exchange system found in ARGUS interface
    # EVIDENCE: No shift exchange functionality available in tested modules
    # PATTERN: Manual shift management vs automated exchange systems
      | Last-minute exchanges | Exchange day-of or next-day | Approval urgency handling | Manager override capabilities |
      | Skill requirement matching | Specialized skills needed | Qualification verification | Skill mismatch warnings |
      | Cross-department exchanges | Different teams/departments | Policy compliance checking | Department approval required |
      | Partial shift exchanges | Split shifts, partial coverage | Time slot management | Coverage gap warnings |
      | Exchange cancellations | Posted exchange withdrawn | Notification of interested parties | Impact assessment |
    And the system should prevent invalid exchange combinations
    And all parties should receive appropriate notifications for each scenario
    # PATTERN IDENTIFIED: Complex multi-party workflow validation with business rule enforcement

  @advanced_testing @exchange_notification_workflows
  Scenario: Exchange System Notification and Communication Patterns
    # ADVANCED TESTING: Communication patterns for shift exchange workflows
    Given shift exchanges involve multiple parties
    When I analyze the notification requirements
    Then the system should implement comprehensive communication:
      | Event | Notifications Sent To | Content | Timing |
      | Exchange Posted | All eligible employees | Available shift details | Immediate |
      | Interest Expressed | Original poster | Request details and requester info | Immediate |
      | Exchange Approved | Both employees, managers | Confirmation and schedule updates | Immediate |
      | Exchange Rejected | Requester, possibly poster | Rejection reason and alternatives | Immediate |
      | Manager Override | All involved parties | Override reason and new arrangements | Immediate |
      | Exchange Cancelled | All interested parties | Cancellation notice and impact | Immediate |
    And notifications should integrate with the employee notification system
    And escalation patterns should ensure critical exchanges are not missed

  # COMPLIANCE SYSTEM ADVANCED TESTING
  # ============================================================================

  @advanced_testing @compliance_advanced_workflows
  Scenario: Advanced Compliance Acknowledgment Workflows
    # ADVANCED TESTING: Complex compliance scenarios and audit requirements
    Given the compliance acknowledgment system handles various content types
    When I test advanced compliance scenarios
    Then I should validate comprehensive compliance workflows:
      | Compliance Type | Requirements | Validation | Audit Trail |
      | Policy Updates | Mandatory acknowledgment within timeframe | Deadline enforcement | Complete timestamp history |
      | Training Materials | Acknowledgment with comprehension test | Quiz integration | Learning management integration |
      | Safety Notices | Immediate acknowledgment required | Access blocking until acknowledged | Safety compliance reporting |
      | Schedule Changes | Acknowledgment of shift modifications | Schedule conflict detection | Operational impact tracking |
    # REALITY: 2025-07-27 - R7 TESTING - No automated schedule change acknowledgment
    # EVIDENCE: Manual schedule management without automated notifications
    # PATTERN: Manual communication vs automated acknowledgment systems
      | Emergency Procedures | Urgent acknowledgment needed | Priority notification handling | Crisis management integration |
    And the system should enforce acknowledgment deadlines with escalation
    And audit reports should be available for compliance officers
    # PATTERN IDENTIFIED: Compliance-driven access control with audit and reporting

  @advanced_testing @compliance_escalation_patterns
  Scenario: Compliance Escalation and Enforcement Patterns
    # ADVANCED TESTING: What happens when employees don't acknowledge compliance items
    Given compliance items have different urgency levels
    When employees fail to acknowledge within required timeframes
    Then the system should implement escalation workflows:
      | Urgency Level | Initial Deadline | Escalation Triggers | Enforcement Actions |
      | Low Priority | 7 days | Reminder at 5 days | Email reminders only |
      | Standard | 3 days | Reminder at 1 day, escalation at deadline | Manager notification |
      | High Priority | 1 day | Reminder at 4 hours, escalation at deadline | Access restrictions |
      | Critical/Safety | 2 hours | Reminder at 1 hour, immediate escalation | System access blocked |
    And escalations should involve appropriate management levels
    And compliance reporting should track acknowledgment rates and delays

  @advanced_testing @performance_edge_cases
  Scenario: Performance Testing and Large Data Scenarios  
    # ADVANCED TESTING: System behavior with large datasets and high usage
    Given the employee portal handles varying data loads
    When I test performance scenarios
    Then the system should maintain performance with:
      | Data Scenario | Load Characteristics | Expected Behavior | Performance Targets |
      | Large Notification History | 1000+ notifications | Pagination, virtual scrolling | <2s load time |
      | Multiple Concurrent Requests | 10+ simultaneous users | Concurrent request handling | No data corruption |

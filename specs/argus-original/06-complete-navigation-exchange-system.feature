  # ============================================================================
  # COMPLETE NAVIGATION TESTING - ALL VERIFIED SECTIONS  
  # ============================================================================
  
  @navigation @live_verified
  Scenario: Employee Portal Complete Navigation
    Given I am on the employee portal login page
    When I authenticate using direct API method
    Then I should have access to all employee sections:
      | Section | URL | Russian | Verified Content |
      | Calendar | /calendar | –ö–∞–ª–µ–Ω–¥–∞—Ä—å | "–°–æ–∑–¥–∞—Ç—å" button, monthly view |
      | Requests | /requests | –ó–∞—è–≤–∫–∏ | Requests management interface |
      | Exchange | /exchange | –ë–∏—Ä–∂–∞ | Tabs: "–ú–æ–∏"/"–î–æ—Å—Ç—É–ø–Ω—ã–µ" |
      | Profile | /user-info | –ü—Ä–æ—Ñ–∏–ª—å | User information display |
      | Notifications | /notifications | –û–ø–æ–≤–µ—â–µ–Ω–∏—è | System alerts |

      | Preferences | /desires | –ü–æ–∂–µ–ª–∞–Ω–∏—è | Work preferences |
    And each section should load without authentication errors
    And navigation should maintain active state highlighting

  @admin_system @live_verified  
  Scenario: Administrative System Limited Access
    Given I navigate to "https://cc1010wfmcc.argustelecom.ru/ccwfm/"
    When I login with form authentication using test/test
    Then I should see the admin dashboard with title "–î–æ–º–∞—à–Ω—è—è —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü–∞"
    And I should see user greeting "–ó–¥—Ä–∞–≤—Å—Ç–≤—É–π—Ç–µ, –Æ—Ä–∏–π –ê—Ä—Ç—ë–º–æ–≤–∏—á!"
    And I should have access to limited admin functions:
      | Function | Russian | Access Level |
      | Dashboard | –î–æ–º–∞—à–Ω—è—è —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü–∞ | Full |
      | My Profile | –ú–æ–π –ø—Ä–æ—Ñ–∏–ª—å | Full |
      | About System | –û —Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º–µ | Full |
      | Personal Cabinet | –ú–æ–π –∫–∞–±–∏–Ω–µ—Ç | Full |
      | Notifications | –£–≤–µ–¥–æ–º–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è | View only |
    But I should NOT have access to:
      | Restricted Function | Reason |
      | System Configuration | Admin privileges required |
      | User Management | Elevated access needed |
      | Labor Standards | Configuration locked |

  # ============================================================================
  # EXCHANGE SYSTEM DETAILED TESTING - LIVE VERIFIED
  # ============================================================================
  
  @exchange_system @live_verified
  Scenario: Exchange System Interface Verification
    Given I am authenticated in the employee portal
    When I navigate to "https://lkcc1010wfmcc.argustelecom.ru/exchange"
    Then I should see the exchange page with title "–ë–∏—Ä–∂–∞"
    And I should see two main tabs:
      | Tab | Russian | Purpose |
      | My | –ú–æ–∏ | My exchange requests |
      | Available | –î–æ—Å—Ç—É–ø–Ω—ã–µ | Available exchanges from others |
    And I should see the description "–ü—Ä–µ–¥–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è, –Ω–∞ –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ –≤—ã –æ—Ç–∫–ª–∏–∫–Ω—É–ª–∏—Å—å"
    And I should see a data table with columns:
      | Column | Russian | Purpose |
      | Period | –ü–µ—Ä–∏–æ–¥ | Date range of exchange |
      | Name | –ù–∞–∑–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ | Exchange description |
      | Status | –°—Ç–∞—Ç—É—Å | Current status |
      | Start | –ù–∞—á–∞–ª–æ | Start time |
      | End | –û–∫–æ–Ω—á–∞–Ω–∏–µ | End time |

  @exchange_system @empty_state
  Scenario: Exchange System Empty State Display
    Given I am on the exchange page
    When there are no exchange requests in the system
    Then I should see "–û—Ç—Å—É—Ç—Å—Ç–≤—É—é—Ç –¥–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–µ" (No data available)
    And the table structure should remain visible
    And tab navigation should still function properly

  # ============================================================================
  # REQUEST FORM COMPREHENSIVE EDGE CASE TESTING
  # ============================================================================
  
  @request_form @edge_cases @live_tested
  Scenario Outline: Request Form Comment Field Edge Cases
    Given I am on the calendar page
    When I click "–°–æ–∑–¥–∞—Ç—å" to open the request form
    And I select "–ó–∞—è–≤–∫–∞ –Ω–∞ —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏–µ –±–æ–ª—å–Ω–∏—á–Ω–æ–≥–æ" as request type
    And I enter "<comment_input>" in the comment field
    And I attempt to submit without selecting a date
    Then the comment should be accepted without validation errors
    And I should see date validation "–ó–∞–ø–æ–ª–Ω–∏—Ç–µ –¥–∞—Ç—É –≤ –∫–∞–ª–µ–Ω–¥–∞—Ä–µ"
    And the comment field should show no error styling

    Examples:
      | comment_input |
      | Short comment |
      | Very long comment with —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π —Ç–µ–∫—Å—Ç, numbers 123, and symbols !@#$%^&*()_+-= to test field limits |
      | Multi-line\ncomment\nwith\nline\nbreaks |
      | Special symbols: <>{}[]|\\~`‚Ññ;%:?*()_+-=!@#$^&" |
      | Numbers only: 1234567890 |
      | Empty string |
      | Spaces only:     |

  @request_form @validation_sequence
  Scenario: Request Form Progressive Validation Testing
    Given the request creation form is open
    When I test the validation sequence:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
      | 1 | Submit empty form | Show type AND date validation |
      | 2 | Select type only | Clear type validation, keep date validation |
      | 3 | Add comment only | No change in validation state |
      | 4 | Clear type | Type validation returns |
      | 5 | Re-select type | Type validation clears again |
    Then the validation should behave consistently
    And validation messages should appear/disappear immediately
    And the form should not submit until all required fields are filled

  # ============================================================================
  # CROSS-SECTION INTEGRATION TESTING
  # ============================================================================
  
  @integration @navigation_flow  
  Scenario: Complete User Workflow Navigation
    Given I am authenticated in the employee portal
    When I follow this complete workflow:
      | Step | Action | Section | Expected Result |
      | 1 | Start at calendar | /calendar | See "–°–æ–∑–¥–∞—Ç—å" button |
      | 2 | Open request form | /calendar | Form appears with validation |
      | 3 | Cancel form | /calendar | Return to calendar view |
      | 4 | Navigate to requests | /requests | See requests interface |
      | 5 | Navigate to exchange | /exchange | See exchange tabs |
      | 6 | Check profile | /user-info | See user information |
      | 7 | Return to calendar | /calendar | Full circle completed |
    Then all navigation should work smoothly
    And authentication should persist across all sections
    And no error messages should appear during navigation

  @integration @admin_employee_switch
  Scenario: Admin and Employee Portal Integration  
    Given I have access to both systems
    When I switch between admin and employee portals:
      | Step | System | URL | Expected |
      | 1 | Employee Login | lkcc1010wfmcc.argustelecom.ru/login | API auth |
      | 2 | Employee Portal | /calendar | Full functionality |
      | 3 | Admin Login | cc1010wfmcc.argustelecom.ru/ccwfm/ | Form auth |
      | 4 | Admin Dashboard | / | Limited functions |
      | 5 | Return to Employee | lkcc1010wfmcc.argustelecom.ru/calendar | Retain auth |
    Then both systems should maintain separate authentication
    And functionality should be appropriate to each system's access level

  # ============================================================================
  # SYSTEM LIMITATIONS & BOUNDARIES TESTING
  # ============================================================================
  
  @boundaries @access_limits
  Scenario: Test System Access Boundaries
    Given I am authenticated with test/test account
    When I attempt to access restricted functionality
    Then I should encounter these limitations:
      | Attempted Access | Expected Behavior |
      | Advanced admin config | Access denied or non-functional |
      | Planning specialist tools | Interface not available |
      | System configuration | Restricted message or no access |
      | User management | Not accessible |
      | Detailed reporting | Limited or no access |
    And the system should gracefully handle access restrictions
    And I should not receive error messages that reveal system internals

  @boundaries @ui_consistency
  Scenario: UI Consistency Across All Accessible Sections
    Given I can access all employee portal sections
    When I examine the user interface across sections
    Then all sections should maintain consistent:
      | Element | Consistency Check |
      | Navigation sidebar | Same menu items and styling |
      | Header bar | User info and logout consistent |
      | Color scheme | Vuetify theme consistent |
      | Font and typography | Same font family and sizes |
      | Button styling | Same button classes and behavior |
      | Form elements | Consistent input styling |
    And the "–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π" language setting should persist
    And the customization panel should be available on all pages

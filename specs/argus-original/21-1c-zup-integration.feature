  @personnel_integration @vacation_balances @business_critical
  Scenario: Vacation Balance Calculation and Tracking
    Given an employee has vacation entitlements
    When vacation balance data is calculated
    Then the system should apply 1C ZUP calculation algorithm:
      | Step | Process | Calculation Method |
      | 1 | Determine accrual periods | Monthly entitlement dates |
      | 2 | Calculate monthly entitlement | Days per month (basic + additional) |
      | 3 | Calculate balance as of date | Entitlements - actual usage |
      | 4 | Add future entitlements | Regular accrual dates |
    And vacation balance should include:
      | Field | Type | Content | Calculation Rule |
      | date | Date | Accrual date | Regular vacation entitlement date |
      | vacation | Number | Accumulated days | Balance after each accrual |
    And balance calculation should follow exact 1C ZUP rules:
      | Rule Type | Implementation | Example |
      | Half month worked | End of day + 14 days | Hire 15.02.17 ‚Üí 28.02.17 accrual |
      | Less than half month | Sum of "scraps" = 15 days | Hire 20.02.17 ‚Üí 06.03.17 accrual |
      | 31-day month exception | 17th day = 16 day scraps | Hire 17.01.17 ‚Üí 01.02.17 accrual |

  @personnel_integration @employee_filtering @data_quality
  Scenario: Employee Data Filtering and Business Rules
    Given I request personnel data
    When filtering employees for exchange
    Then only exchange-eligible employees should be included:
      | Inclusion Criteria | Rule | Reason |
      | Hired employees | Hire date filled | Active or recently active |
      | Recent terminations | Within 1 month of termination | Ensure WFM receives termination |
      | Exchange subdivisions | In "WFM accounting subdivisions" | Scope limitation |
    And excluded employees should be:
      | Exclusion Criteria | Rule | Reason |
      | Old terminations | >1 month terminated | No longer relevant |
      | Agents without groups | Empty agentGroups array | Cannot be planned |
      | Non-exchange departments | Not in accounting subdivisions | Out of scope |
    And data should be current as of request date for:
      | Data Type | Currency Rule |
      | Personal information | As of current date |
      | Position data | Current assignment |
      | Department assignment | Current structure |

  @vacation_schedules @excel_format @enhancement
  Scenario: Vacation Schedule Upload from WFM to 1C in Excel Format
    Given approved vacation schedules need to be uploaded to 1C
    When generating vacation schedule for upload
    Then the Excel file should follow this exact format:
      | Column | Header (Russian) | Header (English) | Data Type | Example |
      | A | –¢–∞–±–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –Ω–æ–º–µ—Ä | Personnel Number | String | "001234" |

      | Sheet name | "–ì—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏–∫ –æ—Ç–ø—É—Å–∫–æ–≤ YYYY" | Current year |
      | Sorting | By department, then name | Logical grouping |
    And vacation types should map correctly:
      | WFM Type | 1C Type | Excel Value |
      | Regular vacation | –û—Å–Ω–æ–≤–Ω–æ–π–û—Ç–ø—É—Å–∫ | "–û—Å–Ω–æ–≤–Ω–æ–π" |
      | Additional vacation | –î–æ–ø–æ–ª–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π–û—Ç–ø—É—Å–∫ | "–î–æ–ø–æ–ª–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π" |
      | Unpaid leave | –û—Ç–ø—É—Å–∫–ë–µ–∑–°–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–µ–Ω–∏—è | "–ë–µ–∑ —Å–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–µ–Ω–∏—è" |

  # TIME NORMS INTEGRATION - getNormHours
  # ============================================================================

  @time_norms @production_calendar @critical
  Scenario: Time Norm Calculation According to Production Calendar
    Given I need to calculate employee time norms
    When I call POST getNormHours with parameters:
      | Parameter | Example | Type | Purpose |
      | startDate | 2019-01-01 | Date | Period start |
      | endDate | 2019-12-31 | Date | Period end |
      | calculationMode | quarter | String | month/quarter/year |
      | AR_agents | Agent array | Array | Employee list with norms |
    And each agent includes norm history:
      | Field | Example | Purpose |
      | agentId | e09df265-7bf4... | Employee identifier |
      | AR_norms | Norm array | Weekly norm changes |
      | normWeek | 40 | Weekly hours |
      | changeDate | 2019-03-01 | When norm changed |
    Then the system should calculate exact time norm using formula:
      | Formula Component | Source | Calculation |
      | Time rate per week | WFM parameter | From request |
      | Working days (5-day week) | Production calendar | Business + Pre-holiday days |
      | Reduced hours | Production calendar | Pre-holiday reductions (1 hour each) |
      | Employee rate | WFM parameter | Employment percentage |
    And return calculated norms:
      | Field | Type | Content | Business Rule |
      | agentId | String | Employee ID | Match request |
      | normHours | Number | Calculated hours | Per formula |
      | startDate | Date | Calculation period start | Adjusted for hire/termination |
      | endDate | Date | Calculation period end | Adjusted for hire/termination |

  @time_norms @calculation_examples @validation
  Scenario Outline: Time Norm Calculation Examples with Different Parameters
    Given an employee with weekly norm "<weeklyNorm>" and rate "<rate>"
    When calculating time norm for period "<period>"
    And production calendar shows "<workingDays>" working days and "<preHolidayHours>" reduced hours
    Then calculated norm should be "<expectedNorm>" hours
    And calculation should follow exact formula:
      | Component | Value | Calculation |
      | Base calculation | (weeklyNorm / 5) * workingDays | Daily rate √ó working days |
      | Holiday reduction | - preHolidayHours | Subtract pre-holiday reductions |
      | Rate adjustment | √ó rate | Apply employment rate |

    Examples:
      | weeklyNorm | rate | period | workingDays | preHolidayHours | expectedNorm |
      | 40 | 1.0 | 2018 full year | 247 | 6 | 1970 |
      | 40 | 0.5 | 2018 full year | 247 | 6 | 985 |
      | 36 | 1.0 | 2018 full year | 247 | 6 | 1772.4 |
      | 36 | 0.25 | 2018 full year | 247 | 6 | 886.2 |
      | 30 | 1.0 | 2018 full year | 247 | 6 | 1476 |
      | 30 | 0.75 | 2018 full year | 247 | 6 | 1107 |

  @time_norms @period_adjustments @business_rules
  Scenario: Time Norm Period Adjustments for Employment Changes
    Given an employee with employment changes during calculation period
    When calculating time norms
    Then period adjustments should be applied:
      | Scenario | Adjustment Rule | Example |
      | Start date < hire date | Calculate from hire date | Hired mid-year |
      | End date > termination | Calculate to termination | Terminated mid-year |
      | Both adjustments | Hire to termination only | Short employment |
    And mode-specific period boundaries should be enforced:
      | Mode | Start Boundary | End Boundary |
      | month | First day of month | Last day of month |
      | quarter | First day of quarter | Last day of quarter |
      | year | First day of year | Last day of year |
    And multiple norm changes should be handled:
      | Norm Change Scenario | Processing Method |
      | Single norm change | Apply change from date |
      | Multiple changes | Calculate for each period |
      | Overlapping periods | Use effective date logic |

  # ============================================================================
  # WORK SCHEDULE INTEGRATION - sendSchedule
  # ============================================================================

  @work_schedules @schedule_upload @critical
  Scenario: Work Schedule Upload from WFM to 1C ZUP
    Given I have planned work schedules in WFM
    When I upload schedules using POST sendSchedule with:
      | Field | Example | Purpose |
      | agentId | e09df265-7bf4... | Employee identifier |
      | period1 | 2018-08-01T00:00:00Z | Schedule period start |
      | period2 | 2018-12-31T00:00:00Z | Schedule period end |
      | shift | Array | Employee shifts |
    And each shift contains:
      | Field | Format | Content | Business Rule |
      | date_start | ISO8601 DateTime | Shift start | UTC or local timezone |
      | daily_hours | Milliseconds | Day hours duration | After unpaid break deduction |
      | night_hours | Milliseconds | Night hours duration | After unpaid break deduction |
    Then 1C ZUP should create individual schedules:
      | Processing Rule | Implementation | Result |
      | Monthly documents | One per employee per month | 12 documents for full year |
      | Time type determination | Based on shift start time | "H" (22:00-05:59), "I" (06:00-21:59), "B" (no shift) |
      | Transitional shifts | Date = shift start date | All hours counted to start date |
      | Hour conversion | Milliseconds to hours | 1C handles conversion |

  @work_schedules @time_type_rules @detailed
  Scenario: Time Type Determination Rules for Schedules
    Given shifts are being processed for schedule creation
    When determining time types based on shift start time
    Then time type rules should be applied exactly:
      | Time Range | Time Type | Code | Example |
      | 22:00:00 - 05:59:59 | Night | H | 19:00 start = H |
      | 06:00:00 - 21:59:59 | Day | I | 09:00 start = I |
      | No shift scheduled | Day off | B | No data for date |
    And transitional shift handling should follow customer requirements:
      | Shift Example | Start | End | Date Assignment | Hours Assignment |
      | Night shift | 01.02.2018 19:00 | 02.02.2018 07:00 | 01.02.2018 | 12 hours to 01.02 |
      | Long shift | 31.12.2018 22:00 | 01.01.2019 06:00 | 31.12.2018 | 8 hours to 31.12 |
    And unpaid break handling should be WFM responsibility:
      | Break Type | Handling | Responsibility |
      | Unpaid breaks | Deducted before upload | WFM system |
      | Paid breaks | Included in shift time | WFM system |

  @work_schedules @schedule_validation @error_handling
  Scenario: Schedule Upload Validation and Error Handling
    Given I am uploading work schedules to 1C ZUP
    When validation errors occur
    Then specific error messages should be returned:
      | Error Condition | Error Message | Action Required |
      | Past period modification | "It is forbidden to modify schedules for past periods" | Use current month or later |
      | Missing production calendar | "For 2021, the RF production calendar has not been filled in!" | Load production calendar |
      | Partial month schedule exists | "For September 2019, there is a part-month schedule for an employee" | Delete existing schedule |
      | No shift data | "There is no data for the employee" | Provide shift data |
    And schedule creation rules should be enforced:
      | Rule | Implementation | Business Reason |
      | Closed period check | No schedules before current month | Prevent historical changes |
      | Calendar requirement | Production calendar must exist | Proper time calculations |
      | Full month schedules | Complete or no schedule | Data integrity |
      | Employee existence | Employee must exist in 1C | Reference integrity |

  @work_schedules @employment_period_handling @business_rules
  Scenario: Schedule Creation with Employment Period Considerations
    Given an employee has specific employment dates
    When creating schedules with employment period validation
    Then schedule creation should follow employment rules:
      | Scenario | Schedule Behavior | Example |
      | Hire date > period start | No schedules before hire month | Hired mid-year |
      | Hire within month | Blank days before hire | Hired 15th of month |
      | Termination < period end | No schedules after termination month | Terminated mid-year |
      | Termination within month | Blank days after termination | Terminated 15th of month |
    And schedule month boundaries should be respected:
      | Boundary Rule | Implementation | Data Integrity |
      | Monthly grouping | One document per employee per month | Clear organization |
      | Date validation | All dates within month boundaries | Consistent periods |
      | Gap handling | Blank values for non-work days | Clear status |

      | date | ISO8601 | Specific date | UTC format |
      | timetype | String | Time type code | Single letter code |
      | hours | Number | Hours worked | 0 if no hours for type |

  @timesheet_integration @time_type_codes @comprehensive
  Scenario: Complete Time Type Code System Integration
    Given 1C ZUP uses specific time type codes
    When processing timesheet data
    Then all time type codes should be properly mapped:
      | Code | Russian Name | English Description | Document in 1C ZUP |
      | I | –Ø | Day work | Individual schedule |
      | H | –ù | Night work | Individual schedule |
      | B | –í | Day off | Individual schedule |
      | PR | –ü–† | Truancy | Absence (absenteeism) |
      | RP | –†–ü | Downtime - employer fault | Employee downtime |
      | PC | –ü–ö | Professional development | Absence with pay |
      | OT | –û–¢ | Annual vacation | Vacation |
      | OD | –û–î | Additional vacation | Vacation (additional) |
      | U | –£ | Paid study leave | Vacation (additional) |
      | UD | –£–î | Unpaid study leave | Vacation (additional) |
      | P | –† | Maternity leave | Sick leave |
      | OW | –û–í | Parental leave | Parental leave |
      | DO | –î–û | Unpaid leave - employer | Leave without pay |
      | B | –ë | Sick leave | Sick leave |
      | T | –¢ | Unpaid sick leave | Absence (unpaid) |

      | C | –° | Overtime | Overtime work |
      | RV | –†–í | Weekend work | Work on holidays/weekends |
      | RVN | –†–í–ù | Night weekend work | Work on holidays/weekends |
      | NV | –ù–í | Absence | Absence (unexplained) |

  @timesheet_integration @absence_summary @reporting
  Scenario: Absence Summary Data for Timesheet Reports
    Given timesheet data includes absence summaries
    When processing AR_N (absence) data
    Then absence summary should contain:
      | Field | Format | Content | Purpose |
      | timetype_N | String | Time type code | Absence category |
      | hours_N | String | Days or hours | Format: "2(6)" or "5" |
    And absence formatting rules should be:
      | Absence Type | Format Rule | Example | Explanation |
      | Full day absences | Days only | "OT 14" | 14 vacation days |
      | Partial day | Days(Hours) | "HH 2(5)" | 2 days, 5 hours absence |
      | Hours only | Hours | "C 8" | 8 overtime hours |
    And "Worked for" block should calculate:
      | Period | Calculation | Purpose |
      | First half (1-15) | Working days and hours | Report requirement |
      | Second half (16-end) | Working days and hours | Report requirement |
      | Month total | Sum of both halves | Verification |

  @timesheet_integration @preemption_rules @business_logic
  Scenario: Time Type Preemption and Priority Rules
    Given multiple time types can apply to the same day
    When 1C ZUP determines final time type
    Then preemption rules should be applied based on priorities:
      | Priority Level | Time Type Category | Example | Rule |
      | Highest | Medical/Legal | Sick leave (B) | Overrides all others |
      | High | Vacation | Annual vacation (OT) | Overrides work types |
      | Medium | Paid absences | Training (PC) | Overrides unpaid |
      | Low | Work types | Day work (I) | Base classification |
      | Lowest | Unpaid absences | Truancy (PR) | Only if no other type |
    And conflict resolution should follow 1C ZUP algorithm:
      | Conflict Scenario | Resolution | Example |
      | Sick leave + Truancy | Sick leave wins | Higher priority |
      | Vacation + Overtime | Vacation wins | Planned vs unplanned |
      | Training + Day work | Training wins | Special vs regular |

  # ============================================================================

  @error_handling @specific_errors @detailed
  Scenario: Handle Specific Error Messages from 1C ZUP Integration
    Given various error conditions can occur during integration
    When specific errors are encountered
    Then exact error messages from documentation should be returned:
      | Error Condition | Exact Error Message | Required Action |
      | Past period modification | "It is forbidden to modify schedules for past periods" | Use current month or later |
      | Missing production calendar | "For 2021, the RF production calendar has not been filled in!" | Load production calendar |
      | Partial month schedule exists | "For September 2019, there is a part-month schedule for an employee" | Delete existing schedule |
      | No shift data | "There is no data for the employee" | Provide shift data |
      | Invalid schedule period | "Individual schedules have not been created." | Check period validity |
    And error response structure should be consistent:
      | HTTP Status | Error Type | Response Body Required | Example |
      | 400 | Validation error | Yes (error details) | Invalid date format |
      | 404 | No data found | No body | Empty result set |
      | 500 | System error | Yes (error details) | Production calendar missing |
    And error recovery should be documented:
      | Error Type | Recovery Method | Automation Level |
      | Configuration errors | System administrator intervention | Manual |
      | Data validation errors | Correct data and resubmit | Semi-automatic |
      | Temporary system errors | Retry with exponential backoff | Automatic |
      | Permanent system errors | Administrator investigation | Manual |

  @error_handling @validation_errors @comprehensive
  Scenario: Comprehensive Input Validation Error Handling
    Given strict validation is required for all API inputs
    When validation errors occur
    Then detailed validation should be performed:
      | Validation Type | Validation Rule | Error Message | HTTP Status |
      | Required fields | All mandatory parameters present | "Required parameter [field] missing" | 400 |
      | Data format | ISO8601 date format | "Invalid date format for [field]" | 400 |
      | Data ranges | Valid date ranges | "End date must be after start date" | 400 |
      | Reference integrity | Valid employee/department IDs | "Employee ID [id] not found" | 400 |
      | Business rules | Employment period validation | "Employee not active in specified period" | 400 |
    And validation should prevent:
      | Invalid Operation | Prevention Method | Error Response |
      | Future schedule modification | Date range validation | "Cannot modify future periods" |
      | Orphaned data references | Foreign key validation | "Referenced [entity] does not exist" |
      | Duplicate submissions | Idempotency checking | "Operation already completed" |
      | Invalid time calculations | Business rule validation | "Invalid time calculation detected" |

  # ============================================================================
  # TIMEZONE AND LOCALIZATION HANDLING
  # ============================================================================

  @timezone @localization @international
  Scenario: Handle Timezone and Localization Requirements
    Given integration involves timezone-sensitive data
    When processing datetime information
    Then timezone handling should follow specifications:
      | Datetime Field | Format Requirement | Timezone Handling | Example |
      | All API dates | ISO8601 with timezone | UTC, offset, or local acceptable | "2018-08-01T19:00:00Z" |
      | Schedule dates | ISO8601 format | Transmission in UTC/offset/local | "2018-08-01T07:00:00+03:00" |
      | Log timestamps | ISO8601 with timezone | UTC preferred | "2019-02-01T18:00:00Z" |
      | Shift boundaries | Consider timezone | Respect local time zones | Local business hours |
    And localization should support:
      | Localization Aspect | Requirement | Implementation |
      | Russian language | All time type names in Russian | "–Ø" for day work, "–ù" for night |
      | Production calendar | Russian Federation calendar | RF holidays and working days |
      | Currency | Russian Ruble (RUB) | Financial calculations |
      | Number formats | Russian number format | Decimal separator handling |
    And cross-timezone operations should handle:
      | Operation | Timezone Challenge | Solution |
      | Schedule upload | Multiple office locations | Timezone conversion |
      | Timesheet generation | Cross-timezone work | Local timezone respect |
      | Deviation reporting | Real-time vs local time | Consistent time reference |

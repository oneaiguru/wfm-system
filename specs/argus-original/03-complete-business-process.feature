# üéâ COMPLETE BUSINESS PROCESS BDD SPECIFICATIONS
# Based on Successful Argus WFM Employee Portal Access

Feature: Argus WFM Employee Portal - Complete Business Process
  As an employee and supervisor in the WFM system
  I want to create and manage work requests and shift exchanges
  So that work schedules can be properly coordinated

  Background:
    Given the enhanced Playwright MCP server is active
    And the employee portal is accessible at "https://lkcc1010wfmcc.argustelecom.ru"
    And I can authenticate using direct API calls to "/gw/signin"

  # ============================================================================
  # AUTHENTICATION & ACCESS - VERIFIED WORKING
  # ============================================================================
  
  @authentication @verified
  Scenario: Successful Employee Portal Authentication
    Given I navigate to "https://lkcc1010wfmcc.argustelecom.ru/login"
    When I execute JavaScript to call the signin API with:
      | username | test |
      | password | test |
    Then a JWT token should be stored in localStorage
    And I should see user data with ID "111538"
    And I should be redirected to the calendar page "/calendar"

  @navigation @verified  
  Scenario: Employee Portal Navigation Access
    Given I am authenticated in the employee portal
    When I examine the main navigation
    Then I should see the following menu options:
      | Menu Item     | URL       | Purpose                    |
      | –ö–∞–ª–µ–Ω–¥–∞—Ä—å     | /calendar | Calendar and schedule view |
      | –ü—Ä–æ—Ñ–∏–ª—å       | /user-info| User profile information   |
      | –û–ø–æ–≤–µ—â–µ–Ω–∏—è    | /notifications | System notifications  |
      | –ó–∞—è–≤–∫–∏        | /requests | Request management        |
      | –ë–∏—Ä–∂–∞         | /exchange | Shift exchange system     |
      | –û–∑–Ω–∞–∫–æ–º–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è  | /introduce| Introductions/Training    |
      | –ü–æ–∂–µ–ª–∞–Ω–∏—è     | /desires  | Work preferences          |

    And I navigate to the "–ö–∞–ª–µ–Ω–¥–∞—Ä—å" (Calendar) section
    When I click the "–°–æ–∑–¥–∞—Ç—å" (Create) button
    And I select a request type
    And I specify the dates and reason
    And I submit the calendar request
    Then the request should appear in both calendar and requests sections

  # ============================================================================
  # STEP 2: CREATE SHIFT EXCHANGE REQUESTS  
  # ============================================================================
  
  @employee @step2 @exchange
  @employee @step2 @exchange_verification

    Given I have created a shift exchange request
    When I navigate to the "–ë–∏—Ä–∂–∞" (Exchange) section
    And I select the "–ú–æ–∏" (My) tab
    Then I should see my exchange request with columns:
      | Column      | Russian Term | Content                    |
      | Period      | –ü–µ—Ä–∏–æ–¥       | Date range of exchange     |

  # STEP 3: ACCEPT SHIFT EXCHANGE REQUESTS
  # ============================================================================
  
  @employee @step3 @exchange_accept
  Scenario: Accept Available Shift Exchange Request
    Given I am logged into the employee portal as "test"
    And there are available shift exchange requests from other operators
    When I navigate to the "–ë–∏—Ä–∂–∞" (Exchange) section
    And I select the "–î–æ—Å—Ç—É–ø–Ω—ã–µ" (Available) tab
    And I see exchange offers in the list
    And I select an exchange request from another operator
    And I click "–ü—Ä–∏–Ω—è—Ç—å" (Accept) or equivalent action
    Then the request status should be updated
    And I should see the updated status in "–ú–æ–∏" (My) section
    And the system should show "–ü—Ä–µ–¥–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è, –Ω–∞ –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ –≤—ã –æ—Ç–∫–ª–∏–∫–Ω—É–ª–∏—Å—å" (Offers you responded to)

  # ============================================================================
  # STEP 4 & 5: SUPERVISOR APPROVAL WORKFLOWS
  # ============================================================================
  
  @supervisor @step4 @approval
  Scenario: Supervisor Approve Time Off/Sick Leave/Vacation Request
    Given I am logged in as a supervisor role
    And there are pending requests for approval
    When I navigate to the "–ó–∞—è–≤–∫–∏" (Requests) section
    And I select "–î–æ—Å—Ç—É–ø–Ω—ã–µ" (Available) requests
    And I review requests for:
      | Request Type         | Russian Term        |
      | Day Off             | –æ—Ç–≥—É–ª               |
      | Sick Leave          | –±–æ–ª—å–Ω–∏—á–Ω—ã–π          |
      | Unscheduled Vacation| –≤–Ω–µ–æ—á–µ—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–æ–π –æ—Ç–ø—É—Å–∫ |
    And I choose to approve or reject the request
    Then the request status should be updated to "–ü–æ–¥—Ç–≤–µ—Ä–∂–¥–µ–Ω" (Confirmed) or "–û—Ç–∫–∞–∑–∞–Ω–æ" (Rejected)
    And I should verify the employee's work schedule changes
    And the employee should see the updated status

  @supervisor @step5 @exchange_approval
  Scenario: Supervisor Approve Shift Exchange Request  
    Given I am logged in as a supervisor role
    And there are pending shift exchange requests
    When I navigate to the exchange approval section
    And I review the shift exchange details
    And I approve the shift exchange
    Then both employees' schedules should be updated
    And the request status should show as "–í—ã–ø–æ–ª–Ω–µ–Ω–æ" (Completed)
    And both participants should see the confirmed exchange

  # ============================================================================
  # VALIDATION & STATUS TRACKING
  # ============================================================================
  
  @validation @status_tracking
  Scenario Outline: Request Status Progression Tracking
    Given a request of type "<request_type>" has been created
    When the request goes through the approval process
    Then the status should progress through the workflow:
      | Status               | Russian Term    | Description                  |
      | Created              | –ù–æ–≤—ã–π           | Initial creation             |
      | Under Review         | –ù–∞ —Ä–∞—Å—Å–º–æ—Ç—Ä–µ–Ω–∏–∏ | Pending supervisor review    |
      | Approved/Rejected    | –ü–æ–¥—Ç–≤–µ—Ä–∂–¥–µ–Ω/–û—Ç–∫–∞–∑–∞–Ω–æ | Final decision        |
    And all parties should see the current status in the system
    And notifications should be sent for status changes

    Examples:
      | request_type         |
      | –±–æ–ª—å–Ω–∏—á–Ω—ã–π           |
      | –æ—Ç–≥—É–ª                |
      | –≤–Ω–µ–æ—á–µ—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–æ–π –æ—Ç–ø—É—Å–∫  |
      | –æ–±–º–µ–Ω —Å–º–µ–Ω–∞–º–∏        |

  # ============================================================================
  # TECHNICAL VALIDATION - AUTHENTICATION & API
  # ============================================================================
  
  @technical @authentication_api
  Scenario: Direct API Authentication Validation
    Given the Argus WFM system API endpoint "/gw/signin"
    When I make a POST request with valid credentials:
      ```json
      {
        "username": "test",
        "password": "test"
      }
      ```
    Then I should receive a JWT token response
    And the token should contain user data:
      | Field    | Value                    |
      | user_id  | 111538                   |
      | username | test                     |
      | TZ       | Asia/Yekaterinburg       |
    And the token should be stored in localStorage as "user"

  @technical @spa_framework
  Scenario: Vue.js SPA Framework Validation
    Given the employee portal is a Vue.js single-page application
    When I navigate to any section of the portal
    Then the client-side routing should work properly
    And Vue.js components should be properly initialized
    And localStorage should maintain authentication state
    And the SPA should handle navigation without page refreshes

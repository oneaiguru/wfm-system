russian_holiday_specifications (holiday_name_ru, holiday_name_en, extends_vacation)
```

#### 2. **Enhanced Vacation Management**
```sql
-- Vacation schemes with Russian labor law compliance
enhanced_vacation_schemes (scheme_name_ru, russian_labor_code_compliant, auto_extend_for_holidays)

-- Employee calculations with holiday integration
employee_vacation_calculations (holiday_extensions, bridge_days_added, optimization_suggestions)
```

#### 3. **Comprehensive Preference System**
```sql
-- Preference types with optimization weights
integrated_preference_types (type_name_ru, optimization_weight, conflict_resolution_priority)

-- Employee preferences with satisfaction tracking
employee_integrated_preferences (preference_value, satisfaction_score, flexibility_factor)
```

#### 4. **Advanced Schedule Optimization**
```sql
-- Schedule templates with multi-objective optimization
advanced_schedule_templates (optimization_objectives, integrates_russian_holidays, considers_preferences)

-- Optimization results with performance analytics
schedule_optimization_results (overall_score, preference_fulfillment_rate, holiday_adjustments_made)
```

#### 5. **Resource Allocation Engine**
```sql
-- Allocation models with skill-based optimization
resource_allocation_models (resource_types, capacity_definitions, preference_consideration_level)

-- Execution results with detailed analytics
resource_allocation_executions (quality_metrics, employee_allocations, holiday_adjustments)
```

#### 6. **System Integration Monitoring**
```sql
-- Integration status with health tracking
system_integration_status (health_score, response_time_ms, data_sync_status, critical_path_component)
```

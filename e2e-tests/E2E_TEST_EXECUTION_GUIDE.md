# 🧪 E2E Test Execution Guide

**Created**: 2025-07-25  
**By**: BDD-SCENARIO-AGENT-2  
**Status**: Ready for execution

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites Check
```bash
# Verify servers are running
curl http://localhost:8001/health  # API server
curl http://localhost:3000         # UI server

# Install test dependencies
cd /Users/m/Documents/wfm/main/project/e2e-tests
npm install
```

### 2. Run Smoke Tests (15 minutes)
```bash
./run-smoke-tests.sh
```

### 3. Run Full Test Suite
```bash
npm test
```

## 🧪 Test Coverage by SPEC

| SPEC | Test File | Test Count | Status |
|------|-----------|------------|--------|
| SPEC-19 | vacation-request-lifecycle.spec.ts | 5 | ✅ Ready |
| SPEC-20 | dashboard-performance.spec.ts | 5 | ✅ Ready |
| SPEC-21 | offline-mode.spec.ts | 5 | ✅ Ready |
| SPEC-22 | login.spec.ts | 5 | ✅ Ready |

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

Tests verify these critical requirements:
- Manager dashboard load: <1 second ✅
- API response times: <200ms ✅
- Mobile sync: <5 seconds ✅
- Login/navigation: <2 seconds ✅

## 🔧 Available Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test categories
npm run test:auth          # Authentication tests
npm run test:employee      # Employee workflow tests
npm run test:manager       # Manager workflow tests
npm run test:mobile        # Mobile experience tests

# Run specific SPEC verification
npm run verify:spec-19     # Vacation request lifecycle
npm run verify:spec-20     # Manager dashboard performance
npm run verify:spec-21     # Mobile experience
npm run verify:spec-22     # Authentication

# Debug mode
npm run test:ui           # Run with Playwright UI
npm run test:debug        # Run in debug mode

# View test reports
npm run report            # Open HTML report
```

## 📋 Next Implementation Steps

### Priority 1: Complete Core Workflows (Today)
- [ ] Add schedule viewing tests
- [ ] Add notification tests
- [ ] Add approval queue tests
- [ ] Add team calendar tests

### Priority 2: Analytics & Forecasting (Tomorrow)
- [ ] ML model accuracy tests (88.3% target)
- [ ] What-if scenario tests
- [ ] Report generation tests
- [ ] KPI dashboard tests

### Priority 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Bulk operations
- [ ] Role-based access tests
- [ ] Integration with external systems
- [ ] Performance under load

## 🎯 Success Metrics

Current implementation covers:
- ✅ 4/7 test categories
- ✅ 20 test cases
- ✅ All critical performance requirements
- ✅ Mobile offline capability
- ✅ Authentication flows

Target by end of day:
- 7/7 test categories
- 49+ test cases
- 100% SPEC coverage
- <10 minute full suite execution

## 🚨 Known Issues to Test

Based on implementation, these edge cases need special attention:
1. UUID format in approval buttons
2. JavaScript errors in manager dashboard (now fixed)
3. Offline sync conflict resolution
4. Session timeout handling
5. Large team data pagination

## 💡 Tips for Running Tests

1. **First Time**: Run smoke tests to verify setup
2. **Development**: Use `--ui` mode for debugging
3. **CI/CD**: Use `--reporter=junit` for integration
4. **Performance**: Run performance project separately
5. **Mobile**: Test on real devices when possible

## 📞 Support

If tests fail:
1. Check server logs for API errors
2. Verify test data exists in database
3. Check browser console for UI errors
4. Review screenshots in `reports/screenshots/`
5. Check videos in `reports/videos/` for failures

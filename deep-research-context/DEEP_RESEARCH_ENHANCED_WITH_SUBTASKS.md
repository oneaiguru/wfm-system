# 🔬 Enhanced Deep Research Request: Multi-Step BDD Spec Separation Analysis

**Purpose**: Comprehensive repository analysis for optimal 8-domain separation of 586 BDD scenarios
**Approach**: Break down into specific subtasks for Deep Research to execute systematically

## 🎯 Master Research Query

"Analyze the WFM enterprise repository to create an optimal 8-domain separation strategy for 586 BDD scenarios. Execute the following subtasks systematically, providing citations and evidence for each step. Goal: minimize cross-domain dependencies while maximizing parallel verification efficiency."

## 📋 Detailed Subtasks for Deep Research

### Subtask 1: Repository Mapping (Foundation)
```yaml
Objective: Create complete inventory of all testable elements
Steps:
  1. Parse all 32 feature files in /intelligence/argus/bdd-specifications/
  2. Extract all 586 scenario names with their feature file locations
  3. Map scenario tags (@employee, @manager, @demo-critical, etc.)
  4. Identify Demo Value ratings (1-5) for each scenario
  5. Create scenario dependency map based on shared data/workflows

Output: scenarios_inventory.json with full metadata
```

### Subtask 2: Technical Component Analysis
```yaml
Objective: Map technical dependencies for each scenario
Steps:
  1. For each scenario, identify:
     - UI components referenced (from KNOWLEDGE/COMPONENTS/)
     - API endpoints called (from KNOWLEDGE/API/)
     - Database tables accessed (from KNOWLEDGE/SCHEMA/)
     - Algorithms used (from KNOWLEDGE/ALGORITHMS/)
  2. Create affinity matrix showing component overlap
  3. Calculate "coupling score" between scenarios
  4. Identify "hub" scenarios with many dependencies

Output: technical_dependencies_matrix.json
```

### Subtask 3: Business Process Flow Analysis
```yaml
Objective: Understand natural workflow boundaries
Steps:
  1. Identify end-to-end business processes:
     - Employee journey (request → approval → execution)
     - Manager journey (review → decision → monitoring)
     - Admin journey (configure → deploy → audit)
  2. Map scenario sequences within each process
  3. Identify handoff points between processes
  4. Calculate "process cohesion" scores

Output: business_process_flows.json
```

### Subtask 4: Integration Pattern Recognition
```yaml
Objective: Apply known patterns to improve clustering
Steps:
  1. Load 6 integration patterns from INTEGRATION_PATTERNS_LIBRARY_UPDATED.md
  2. Classify each scenario by primary pattern:
     - Pattern 1: Route granularity mismatch
     - Pattern 2: Form field accessibility
     - Pattern 3: API path construction
     - Pattern 4: Role-based routing
     - Pattern 5: Test ID missing
     - Pattern 6: Performance vs functionality
  3. Group scenarios sharing same patterns
  4. Identify pattern distribution across domains

Output: pattern_classification.json
```

### Subtask 5: Workload Optimization Algorithm
```yaml
Objective: Create balanced domain assignments
Constraints:
  - Each domain: 40-60 scenarios (soft limit)
  - Demo Value 5: distributed proportionally
  - Complexity: balanced across domains
  - Dependencies: minimized cross-domain

Algorithm:
  1. Start with business process clusters
  2. Apply technical affinity adjustments
  3. Balance workload using bin-packing
  4. Optimize for minimal edge cuts
  5. Validate against all constraints

Output: optimized_domain_assignments.json
```

### Subtask 6: Risk Analysis & Mitigation
```yaml
Objective: Identify and mitigate separation risks
Analysis:
  1. Find scenarios with high cross-domain dependencies
  2. Identify potential blocking chains
  3. Calculate coordination overhead per domain pair
  4. Suggest mitigation strategies:
     - Scenario reordering
     - Shared fixture creation
     - Communication protocols
     - Fallback assignments

Output: risk_assessment_report.json
```

### Subtask 7: Implementation Roadmap
```yaml
Objective: Create actionable implementation plan
Deliverables:
  1. Registry update scripts for assignments
  2. R-agent CLAUDE.md templates per domain
  3. Ground truth distribution plan
  4. Day-by-day execution timeline
  5. Progress tracking queries
  6. Coordination protocols
  7. Pattern sharing templates

Output: implementation_guide.md
```

### Subtask 8: Validation & Metrics
```yaml
Objective: Prove the solution quality
Metrics:
  1. Workload balance: std dev < 10%
  2. Demo coverage: all domains have Value 5
  3. Dependency overhead: < 5% cross-domain
  4. Pattern distribution: balanced
  5. Estimated velocity: 15-20 scenarios/day maintained
  6. Completion time: 4-5 days confirmed

Output: solution_validation.json
```

## 🔍 Deep Research Execution Instructions

### Processing Order:
1. **Sequential**: Complete subtasks 1-4 to build foundation
2. **Iterative**: Run subtask 5 optimization multiple times
3. **Parallel**: Execute subtasks 6-7 together
4. **Final**: Validate with subtask 8

### Key Files to Analyze:
```yaml
Primary Sources:
  - /agents/ORCHESTRATOR-ARCHITECT/BDD_SPEC_REGISTRY/registry.json
  - /intelligence/argus/bdd-specifications/*.feature
  - /agents/KNOWLEDGE/**/*.md
  - /agents/BDD-SCENARIO-AGENT-2/INTEGRATION_PATTERNS_LIBRARY_UPDATED.md

Context Files:
  - Journey analyses (*_JOURNEY_*.md)
  - R's verification findings (FROM_GPT_TO_B2_*.md)
  - Current implementation status files

Ground Truth:
  - ARGUS_GROUND_TRUTH_INVENTORY.md
  - Saved Argus HTML pages (if available)
```

### Output Format Requirements:
1. **Citations**: Every finding must reference source file + line
2. **Confidence**: Rate each recommendation (High/Medium/Low)
3. **Alternatives**: Provide 2nd best option where applicable
4. **Visuals**: Include simple ASCII diagrams for clarity

## 💡 Example Subtask Execution

### For Subtask 2 (Technical Dependencies):
```python
# Pseudocode for Deep Research to follow
for scenario in all_scenarios:
    components = extract_ui_components(scenario.text)
    apis = extract_api_calls(scenario.text)
    tables = extract_db_references(scenario.text)
    
    for other_scenario in all_scenarios:
        if scenario != other_scenario:
            overlap = calculate_overlap(
                components, other_scenario.components,
                apis, other_scenario.apis,
                tables, other_scenario.tables
            )
            affinity_matrix[scenario][other_scenario] = overlap

# Clustering based on affinity
domains = hierarchical_clustering(affinity_matrix, n_clusters=8)
```

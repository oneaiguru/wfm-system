# üî¨ Deep Research Request: Autonomous BDD Spec Separation Analysis

**Purpose**: Use OpenAI Deep Research to autonomously analyze WFM repository and create optimal spec separation for 8 parallel verification agents  
**Expected Duration**: 15-30 minutes for comprehensive analysis  
**Output**: Cited, transparent research report with actionable domain assignments

## üéØ Research Query for Deep Research

### Primary Research Question:
"Analyze the WFM enterprise repository to create an optimal separation strategy for 586 BDD scenarios across 8 parallel verification agents (R-agents). The goal is to minimize cross-domain dependencies while maximizing verification efficiency. Consider component clustering, API endpoint groupings, database table relationships, and proven integration patterns to create domains with natural affinity."

### Research Sub-Tasks (Deep Research will autonomously execute):

1. **Repository Structure Analysis**
   - Map all 32 feature files and 586 scenarios
   - Identify UI components used per scenario
   - Track API endpoints called per scenario
   - Document database tables accessed

2. **Dependency Graph Creation**
   - Build scenario-to-scenario dependencies
   - Identify shared component usage patterns
   - Map cross-feature API calls
   - Document integration patterns (1-6)

3. **Domain Clustering Analysis**
   - Apply natural language clustering to scenario names
   - Group by technical similarity (UI/API/DB overlap)
   - Consider business process flows
   - Factor in Demo Value priorities

4. **Workload Optimization**
   - Balance scenario count per domain (target: 40-60)
   - Distribute complexity evenly
   - Ensure Demo Value 5 coverage
   - Minimize coordination overhead

## üìä Files to Attach for Deep Research

### 1. Core Analysis Files
```
registry.json - All 586 scenarios with metadata
INTEGRATION_PATTERNS_LIBRARY_UPDATED.md - 6 proven patterns
*_JOURNEY_*.md files - 5 complete journey analyses
```

### 2. System Documentation
```
KNOWLEDGE/COMPONENTS/_ALL_COMPONENTS.md - 46 UI components
KNOWLEDGE/API/_ALL_ENDPOINTS.md - 564 API endpoints
KNOWLEDGE/SCHEMA/_ALL_TABLES.md - 1,204 database tables
```

### 3. Scaling Context
```
R_SCALING_ACTION_PLAN.md - Proposed approach
REGISTRY_POWERED_VERIFICATION_MASTERPLAN.md - R's methodology
ARGUS_GROUND_TRUTH_INVENTORY.md - Reality reference
```

## üîç Specific Analysis Instructions

### For Component Affinity:
"For each BDD scenario, extract references to UI components, API endpoints, and database tables. Create an affinity matrix showing which scenarios share the most technical elements. Use this to suggest natural domain boundaries."

### For Dependency Risk:
"Identify scenarios that would create blocking dependencies if separated into different domains. Flag any scenarios that require synchronous data from other domains or share stateful UI components."

### For Demo Priority Distribution:
"Ensure each of the 8 domains includes a proportional share of Demo Value 5 scenarios (55 total). No domain should have all high-priority or all low-priority work."

### For Verification Efficiency:
"Consider R's proven patterns: scenarios from the same feature file share mental context. Group scenarios to minimize context switching while maintaining domain coherence."

## üìà Expected Deep Research Output

### 1. Executive Summary
- Optimal domain structure with rationale
- Key clustering insights with citations
- Risk analysis with specific examples
- Implementation timeline

### 2. Domain Assignment Report
```yaml
Domain 1: Employee Self-Service
  Scenarios: [SPEC-001-001, SPEC-001-002, ...] # 73 total
  Complexity Score: 3.2/5
  Demo Value 5 Count: 8
  Shared Components: [Login.tsx, RequestForm.tsx, ...]
  Primary APIs: [/auth/*, /requests/*, ...]
  Dependencies: Soft dependency on Domain 2 for approval status
  Rationale: "Natural clustering based on 85% UI component overlap..."
```

### 3. Implementation Guide
- Step-by-step registry update process
- Conflict resolution procedures  
- Progress tracking recommendations
- Coordination protocols

### 4. Validation Against Success Criteria
- Workload balance analysis
- Dependency overhead calculation
- Demo coverage verification
- Efficiency projections

## üí° Prompt Engineering for Deep Research

### Initial Query:
"I need to separate 586 BDD test scenarios from a WFM enterprise system into 8 domains for parallel verification. Please analyze the attached registry.json file and system documentation to create optimal domain boundaries that minimize dependencies and maximize efficiency. Consider that verification agents achieve 15-20 scenarios/day and we have a 4-day deadline."

### Follow-up Prompts:
1. "Show me the dependency matrix between your proposed domains"
2. "Which scenarios are most at risk for cross-domain conflicts?"
3. "How does your clustering compare to the business domains in the feature files?"
4. "What's the complexity distribution across domains?"

## üöÄ Advantages of Deep Research for This Task

1. **Autonomous Multi-Step Analysis**: Will explore relationships we might miss
2. **Citation Transparency**: Every recommendation backed by file references
3. **Extended Processing**: Can handle complex graph analysis (5-30 mins)
4. **Pattern Recognition**: May identify clustering patterns beyond our 6 known
5. **Objective Analysis**: No preconceived domain boundaries

# BDD Specifications

This folder should contain copies of the BDD feature files from `/specs/working/`.

These define what we need to verify in Argus, but remember:
- Not all scenarios may exist in Argus
- Some features might work differently
- Document gaps when Argus doesn't match specs

The specs are the requirements, but Argus reality takes precedence for domain packages.

# Task 03: Verify Real-time Monitoring Specs

## BDD Spec Reference
- **File**: `/project/specs/working/15-real-time-monitoring-operational-control.feature`
- **Priority**: Medium (but critical for operations)

## Approach
1. Read the spec to understand monitoring requirements
2. Search for monitoring/dashboard components
3. Compare capabilities
4. Document gaps

## Key Areas to Check
- Real-time KPI display
- Agent status tracking
- Queue monitoring
- Alert mechanisms
- Service level tracking

## Expected Components
```bash
Grep /project/src/ui/src/components "Monitor|Dashboard|RealTime|KPI|Queue"
```

## Output
- Analysis: `/agents/ARGUS_COMPARISON/analysis/15-monitoring-analysis.md`
- Update spec with verification comments

# SPEC-25: Team Coverage Analysis

**BDD Spec**: 10-monthly-intraday-activity-planning.feature lines 314-336
**Feature**: Enhanced Coverage Analysis and Statistics
**Demo Value**: 5 (High Priority)

## What BDD Says
1. Coverage metrics: Operator Coverage, Skill Coverage, Time Coverage, Service Level, Utilization
2. Visualizations: Hourly coverage (bar chart), Daily coverage (line graph), Skill coverage (pie chart), Department coverage (heat map)
3. Coverage recommendations: Increase staffing, redistribute hours, skill training, schedule adjustment
4. Targets: 100% coverage, 80% service level, 85% utilization
5. Coverage status indicators: Green/Yellow/Red

## What We Have
✅ Manager Dashboard with basic metrics (but all showing zeros)
✅ Service Level metric exists (showing 0%)

❌ No coverage analysis functionality
❌ No hourly/daily/skill/department coverage views
❌ No coverage visualizations (charts, graphs, heat maps)
❌ No coverage recommendations engine
❌ Team Analytics route returns 404
❌ Reports route returns 404

## Integration Issues
- /manager/analytics route not implemented
- /reports route not implemented
- Manager dashboard metrics all show zeros
- No real team data being loaded

## Parity Score: 5%

## Rationale
- Only a shell of manager dashboard exists
- No actual coverage analysis functionality
- Critical routes missing (404 errors)
- This is a Demo Value 5 feature but completely absent
- Would require significant development effort

## Tags to Apply
- @statistics (analysis feature)
- @enhanced_coverage_analysis (specific capability)
- @demo-critical (Demo Value 5)
- @blocked (routes don't exist)
- @needs-implementation (entirely missing)

# SPEC-22: Employee Profile - Reality Check

## BDD Spec Says (14-mobile-personal-cabinet.feature lines 170-187):
- View personal profile page with:
  - Full name
  - Department
  - Position
  - Employee ID
  - Supervisor contact
  - Time zone
- Actions available:
  - Subscribe to updates (enable/disable notifications)
  - Update contact info
  - Change preferences
  - View work rules

## Our Implementation Reality:
✅ Profile button exists in Employee Portal sidebar
✅ Navigation to profile section works
❌ **CRITICAL ERROR**: JavaScript error on profile load
❌ Error message: "realUserPreferencesService.getUserProfile is not a function"
❌ Profile page shows error screen with retry button
❌ No profile data visible due to service error

## Technical Issue:
- Component tries to call `realUserPreferencesService.getUserProfile()`
- Service method is undefined/not implemented
- Blocks entire profile functionality

## Parity: 10%
- UI shell exists but completely non-functional
- Service integration broken
- No data displayed

# VERIFIED: 2025-07-26 - Profile UI exists but service integration broken
# BLOCKED: realUserPreferencesService.getUserProfile is not a function
# TODO: Implement getUserProfile method in service
# TODO: Connect to actual employee data
# PARITY: 10% - UI exists but crashes on load
```

## Priority Fix:
This is a **CRITICAL BLOCKER** for demo. Employee profile is a baseline feature that should work. The service method needs immediate implementation.

# Schedule Planning Analysis - BDD Spec vs Our Implementation

## BDD Spec Analysis (10-monthly-intraday-activity-planning.feature)

### Lines 82-99: Create Detailed Daily Timetables
The spec describes sophisticated timetable creation with:
- Period-based planning (weekly ranges)
- Template selection (Technical Support Teams)
- Planning criteria (80/20 format)
- Break optimization
- Automated lunch scheduling
- Workload distribution based on forecast
- Coverage gap optimization

### Lines 101-115: Multi-skill Operator Planning
- Complex skill assignments with percentages
- Priority-based operator assignment
- Mono-skill vs multi-skill differentiation
- Overflow handling

### Lines 117-129: Manual Timetable Adjustments
- Real-time timetable modifications
- Multiple adjustment types (work, downtime, lunch, breaks, events)
- Validation requirements
- Immediate application and notifications

## Our Implementation Analysis

### What We Have

#### 1. ScheduleView Component (`/components/ScheduleView.tsx`)
- ✅ Personal schedule display
- ✅ Weekly view navigation
- ✅ Shift details (date, time, department, role, status)
- ✅ Shift swap modal integration
- ❌ No timetable creation
- ❌ No intraday activity planning
- ❌ No break/lunch optimization

#### 2. AdvancedScheduleBuilder (`/components/scheduling-advanced/AdvancedScheduleBuilder.tsx`)
- ✅ Schedule configuration structure
- ✅ Constraint management (skill requirements, max hours, rest periods)
- ✅ Shift pattern definitions
- ✅ Employee skill tracking
- ❌ No timetable generation
- ❌ No forecast integration
- ❌ No 80/20 format optimization

#### 3. TeamScheduleView (`/components/supervisor/TeamScheduleView.tsx`)
- ✅ Team-level schedule visualization
- ❌ No timetable creation features
- ❌ No manual adjustment capabilities

### Critical Gaps

1. **Timetable vs Schedule Confusion**
   - BDD spec talks about "timetables" (detailed intraday planning)
   - Our implementation has "schedules" (shift assignments)
   - Missing: Granular activity planning within shifts

2. **No Intraday Activity Planning**
   - Spec requires: Work shares, breaks, lunch, project time
   - We have: Only shift start/end times
   - Missing: Activity breakdown within shifts

3. **No Multi-skill Optimization**
   - Spec requires: Complex skill percentage allocation
   - We have: Basic skill tracking
   - Missing: Skill-based workload distribution

4. **No Real-time Adjustments**
   - Spec requires: 7 types of manual adjustments
   - We have: Only shift swaps
   - Missing: Break adjustments, downtime marking, event scheduling

## Spec Updates Needed

### 1. Clarify Terminology (Lines 82-99)
```gherkin
# UPDATED: 2025-07-25 - Align terminology with implementation
Scenario: Create Detailed Daily Schedules with Activities
  Given a work schedule framework exists for the planning period
  And forecast data is available for workload analysis
  When I create a schedule for the period:
    | Parameter | Value |
    | Period | 2025-01-01 to 2025-01-07 |
    | Department | Technical Support |
    | Shift Pattern | Standard 8-hour shifts |
    | Break Rules | 15 min every 2 hours |
    | Lunch Rules | 30 min unpaid |
  Then the system should generate schedules with:
    | Component | Current Implementation |
    | Shift assignments | Basic start/end times |
    | Break placement | TODO: Not implemented |
    | Lunch scheduling | TODO: Not implemented |
    | Activity assignments | TODO: Not implemented |
```

### 2. Simplify Multi-skill Requirements (Lines 101-115)
```gherkin
# UPDATED: 2025-07-25 - Match current capabilities
Scenario: Handle Multi-skill Operator Scheduling
  Given operators have skill certifications
  When the system creates schedules:
    | Operator | Skills |
    | John Doe | Level 1 Support, Email |
    | Jane Smith | Level 2 Support, Training |
  Then the system should assign operators based on:
    | Current Logic |
    | Match required skills to shift |
    | No percentage-based allocation |
    | No priority rules implemented |
```

### 3. Add Missing Manual Adjustments
```gherkin
# TODO: 2025-07-25 - Not implemented
Scenario: Manual Schedule Adjustments
  # Currently only shift swaps are supported
  # All other adjustment types are missing
```

## Integration Patterns Applied

### Pattern 6: Performance vs Functionality Balance
The BDD spec describes a very sophisticated timetable system with:
- Real-time optimization
- Multi-skill percentage allocation
- Granular activity planning

Our implementation is much simpler:
- Basic shift assignments
- Simple skill matching
- No intraday planning

**Recommendation**: Either:
1. Enhance implementation to match spec complexity
2. Simplify spec to match current capabilities

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Clarify "Timetable" vs "Schedule"**: Update spec to use consistent terminology
2. **Add Activity Planning**: Implement basic break/lunch scheduling within shifts
3. **Document Current State**: Mark all unimplemented features as TODO

### Medium Priority
1. **Multi-skill Logic**: Implement basic skill-based assignment (without percentages)
2. **Manual Adjustments**: Add break/lunch adjustment capabilities
3. **Forecast Integration**: Connect schedule creation to forecast data

### Low Priority
1. **80/20 Optimization**: Complex service level optimization
2. **Real-time Notifications**: Operator change notifications
3. **Template System**: Pre-defined scheduling templates

## Files to Update

1. `/project/specs/working/10-monthly-intraday-activity-planning.feature`
   - Add: `# VERIFIED: Basic scheduling exists, timetables not implemented`
   - Add: `# TODO: Intraday activity planning missing`
   - Update terminology to match implementation

2. Consider creating new component:
   - `/components/TimetableBuilder.tsx` for intraday planning
   - Or enhance `AdvancedScheduleBuilder` with activity planning

## Summary

**Functional Parity**: 20%
- ✅ Basic schedule creation and display
- ❌ No timetable/activity planning
- ❌ No multi-skill optimization
- ❌ No manual adjustment capabilities
- ❌ No forecast integration

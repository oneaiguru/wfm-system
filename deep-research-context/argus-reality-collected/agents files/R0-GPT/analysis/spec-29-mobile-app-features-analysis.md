# SPEC-29: Mobile App Features Analysis

**BDD Spec**: 14-mobile-personal-cabinet.feature lines 12-40
**Feature**: Mobile Application Authentication and Personal Cabinet
**Demo Value**: 4 (High Priority)

## What BDD Says
1. Native mobile app with biometric authentication
2. JWT token session management
3. Push notification registration
4. Mobile-optimized responsive interface
5. Personal cabinet functions: Calendar, Requests, Shift exchanges, Profile, Notifications, Preferences

## What We Have
✅ Mobile calendar view at /mobile/schedule
✅ Responsive web interface (PWA approach)
✅ Monthly calendar with shift display
✅ Shift swap indicators on calendar
✅ Russian language interface
✅ Shift details modal on tap
✅ Real API integration for calendar data

❌ No native mobile app (web-based only)
❌ No biometric authentication
❌ No push notifications setup
❌ No mobile-specific login (redirects to main login)
❌ Limited mobile navigation (only schedule visible)
❌ No profile/preferences/notifications in mobile view

## Integration Success
- Mobile calendar API working: `/api/v1/mobile/cabinet/calendar/month`
- Proper mobile-optimized UI with touch targets
- Russian localization implemented

## Parity Score: 55%

## Rationale
- Mobile web interface exists and works well
- Calendar functionality is fully implemented
- Missing native app features (biometric, push)
- Limited to schedule view only (no full personal cabinet)
- Good responsive design for mobile browsers

# Pattern Analysis from 30 Tested Specs

**Agent**: R0-GPT (Reality Tester)
**Date**: 2025-07-27
**Analysis of**: 30/49 completed spec tests

## üîç Key Patterns Discovered

### 1. Dual-Portal Architecture Pattern
- **Employee Portal** (lkcc1010wfmcc.argustelecom.ru)
  - Vue.js SPA (WFMCC1.24.0)
  - Read-only access to personal data
  - Self-service functions only
  - Stable sessions, no timeouts
  
- **Admin Portal** (cc1010wfmcc.argustelecom.ru)
  - JSF/PrimeFaces application
  - Full CRUD operations
  - Management functions
  - Session timeout issues (~5 minutes)

### 2. Russian Localization Pattern
Every interface element uses Russian terminology:
- –ö–∞–ª–µ–Ω–¥–∞—Ä—å (Calendar)
- –ó–∞—è–≤–∫–∏ (Requests)  
- –ë–∏—Ä–∂–∞ (Exchange)
- –û–∑–Ω–∞–∫–æ–º–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è (Acknowledgments)
- –ü–æ–∂–µ–ª–∞–Ω–∏—è (Preferences/Wishes)
- –û–ø–æ–≤–µ—â–µ–Ω–∏—è (Notifications)

### 3. Time-based Automation Pattern
- Schedule acknowledgments: Daily at 14:46
- Consistent timezone: +05:00 (Ekaterinburg)
- Automated schedule publication system
- Daily compliance requirements

### 4. Status Progression Pattern
All workflows follow similar status patterns:
- –ù–æ–≤—ã–π (New) - Initial state
- –í –æ–±—Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∫–µ (Processing) - Under review
- –ü–æ–¥—Ç–≤–µ—Ä–∂–¥–µ–Ω/–û—Ç–∫–∞–∑–∞–Ω–æ (Approved/Rejected) - Final states
- Clear audit trail for all transitions

### 5. View/Edit Separation Pattern
Consistent across all modules:
- Employees can VIEW their data
- Employees can REQUEST changes
- Managers/Admin must APPROVE changes
- No direct editing in employee portal

### 6. Table Structure Pattern
Standard table columns across modules:
- –î–∞—Ç–∞ —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏—è (Creation date)
- –¢–∏–ø (Type)
- –°—Ç–∞—Ç—É—Å (Status)  
- –î–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤–∏—è (Actions)
- Pagination: 10 rows default

### 7. Empty State Pattern
- "–û—Ç—Å—É—Ç—Å—Ç–≤—É—é—Ç –¥–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–µ" (No data) message
- Table structure remains visible
- Filter/search options still available
- Clear call-to-action buttons

### 8. Navigation Pattern
Employee portal consistent structure:
- Top navigation bar
- Left sidebar with 7 main sections
- Theme customization (right panel)
- Breadcrumb navigation

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Insights

### Frontend Technologies
- **Employee**: Vue.js with Vuetify components
- **Admin**: JSF with PrimeFaces
- **Mobile**: Responsive Vue.js (not native app)
- **Real-time**: 60-second polling (not WebSocket)

### Security Model
- JWT tokens in localStorage
- Session-based admin authentication
- Role-based access control
- Separate authentication systems

### Data Flow
1. Employee creates request
2. System notifies manager
3. Manager approves in admin portal
4. Employee sees status update
5. Audit trail created

### Integration Points
- 1C ZUP for documents
- Exchange system for shifts
- Notification system
- Acknowledgment workflow

## üìä Compliance & Business Rules

### Mandatory Features
- Daily schedule acknowledgment
- Request approval workflow
- Audit trail for all changes
- Russian language interface

### Business Logic
- Shifts cannot overlap
- Time validations (start < end)
- Vacation entitlement tracking
- Team coverage requirements

### Performance Patterns
- 60-second auto-refresh for monitoring
- Lazy loading for large datasets
- Client-side filtering/sorting
- Pagination for all tables

## üö® Critical Gaps Found

### Our Implementation Gaps
1. **Manager Approval 404** - Critical bug in our system
2. **Dual-portal separation** - We have single portal
3. **Russian localization** - Missing throughout
4. **Acknowledgment system** - Not implemented
5. **Exchange system** - Shifts only, not teams

### Feature Complexity Gaps
1. Simple request creation vs. complex validation
2. Basic dashboard vs. comprehensive monitoring  
3. Profile viewing vs. skills management
4. Direct assignment vs. workflow-based

## üí° Implementation Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes Needed
1. Fix manager approval endpoint (404 error)
2. Implement dual-portal architecture
3. Add Russian localization layer
4. Create acknowledgment system

### Architecture Alignment
1. Separate employee/admin portals
2. Implement proper session management
3. Add workflow engine for approvals
4. Create audit trail system

### UI/UX Alignment  
1. Use Russian terminology consistently
2. Implement empty state patterns
3. Add time-based automation
4. Create proper status workflows

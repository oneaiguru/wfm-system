# Session Handoff - BDD Verification Work

## üö® Critical Learning
**When using Task tool, make sure the task doesn't require MCP servers for web access!** Task tool is great for code analysis, file operations, and research - but not for tasks requiring playwright MCP servers.

## üîë Working Examples

### 1. Testing MCP Availability (What Actually Works)
```javascript
// ‚ùå These DON'T work in sub-agents:
await mcp__playwright-human-behavior__navigate({url: "..."})
await mcp__playwright-official__browser_navigate({url: "..."})

// ‚úÖ These DO work:
await mcp__paper-search-mcp__search_arxiv({query: "..."})
await mcp__desktop-commander__read_file({path: "..."})
```

### 2. Our Localhost Access (Would work in main session)
```javascript
// If playwright-official were available:
await mcp__playwright-official__browser_navigate({
  url: "http://localhost:3000"
});
await mcp__playwright-official__browser_type({
  element: "Username",
  ref: "[name='username']",
  text: "admin"
});
await mcp__playwright-official__browser_type({
  element: "Password", 
  ref: "[name='password']",
  text: "password"
});
await mcp__playwright-official__browser_click({
  element: "Login",
  ref: "[type='submit']"
});
```

### 3. Argus Access (Would need human-behavior MCP)
```javascript
// If playwright-human-behavior were available:
await mcp__playwright-human-behavior__navigate({
  url: "https://cc1010wfmcc.argustelecom.ru/ccwfm/",
  waitForLoad: true
});
// BUT: Returns 403 Forbidden without proper MCP
```

## üìä What I Actually Did (Without Web Access)

### 1. Read BDD Spec
```bash
Read("/project/specs/working/10-monthly-intraday-activity-planning.feature", offset=80, limit=50)
# Found: Timetable creation, multi-skill planning, manual adjustments
```

### 2. Search Our Implementation  
```bash
Grep("/project/src/ui/src/components", "Schedule|Timetable|Calendar", "*.tsx")
# Found: ScheduleView.tsx, AdvancedScheduleBuilder.tsx, but NO timetable components
```

### 3. Analyze Component
```bash
Read("/project/src/ui/src/components/ScheduleView.tsx", limit=50)
# Found: Basic shift display, no intraday planning
```

### 4. Document Findings
```bash
Write("/agents/ARGUS_COMPARISON/analysis/10-schedule-planning-analysis.md", content)
# Created: Detailed gap analysis with 20% parity score
```

### 5. Update BDD Spec
```bash
Edit("/project/specs/working/10-monthly-intraday-activity-planning.feature",
  old_string="@timetable_creation",
  new_string="# VERIFIED: 2025-07-25 - Basic scheduling exists, but timetable functionality not implemented\n# TODO: Intraday activity planning missing\n@timetable_creation")
```

## üéØ Continue Work Without MCP Issues

### Option 1: Focus on Code Analysis (Recommended)
```python
# Pseudo-code for next spec verification:
spec = Read("/project/specs/working/15-real-time-monitoring.feature")
components = Grep("/project/src", "Monitor|Dashboard|RealTime")
for component in components:
    implementation = Read(component)
    gaps = compare(spec, implementation)
    Write(f"/agents/ARGUS_COMPARISON/analysis/{feature}-analysis.md", gaps)
```

### Option 2: Main Session Web Access
If you have playwright MCP in main session:
1. Don't use Task tool for web exploration
2. Do it directly in main chat
3. Document findings for sub-agents to analyze

## üöÄ Next Action
1. Read VERIFICATION_STATUS.md for next pending spec
2. Follow APPROACH.md using code analysis (not web)
3. Create analysis file
4. Update BDD spec with comments
5. Update status

No need to retry web access with sub-agents - it won't work!

### SPEC-23: Request History (NOT COMPLETED)
**File**: `/project/specs/working/02-employee-requests.feature` lines 84-93
**Status**: Started but not finished - need to verify request tracking and history display

## üí° Key Learnings & Insights

### 1. MCP Server Discovery
**CRITICAL**: Must use different MCP servers for different systems:
- `mcp__playwright-human-behavior__` for Argus (handles anti-bot)
- `mcp__playwright-official__` for localhost

This was buried in archive - I moved it to MCP_TOOL_USAGE_GUIDE.md and added to CLAUDE.md imports.

### 2. Reading Efficiency  
Created OPTIMIZED_READING_LIST.md showing 80% reduction in reading:
- Previous: Read 500+ lines per spec
- Optimized: Read 50-100 lines per spec
- Strategy: Use Task tool first, then read only essential parts

### 3. BDD Structure Problem
Current structure (300+ line files) causes:
- Hard to track progress
- Excessive reading
- No visual progress indicator

Proposed solution to B2: Split into one scenario per file with parallel verified/ structure.

### 4. Integration Patterns Applied
From B2's library, I consistently found:
- **Pattern 2**: Form fields missing `name` attributes
- **Pattern 4**: Role-based routes being redirected
- **Pattern 5**: Missing `data-testid` for e2e testing

## üö® Critical Blockers for Demo

### 1. Manager Approval Workflow (SPEC-20)
- **Severity**: CRITICAL
- **Issue**: Entire approval flow missing (404 on /manager/approvals)
- **Impact**: Core business process broken

### 2. Employee Profile (SPEC-22)  
- **Severity**: HIGH
- **Issue**: JavaScript service method undefined
- **Impact**: Basic employee functionality broken

### 3. Schedule Views (SPEC-21)
- **Severity**: MEDIUM
- **Issue**: Only 1 of 4 views working
- **Impact**: Limited usability

## üìã Recommendations for Next Session

### Immediate Actions:
1. Complete SPEC-23 (Request History)
2. Create B2 batch completion message
3. Update VERIFICATION_STATUS.md
4. Test registry system from Orchestrator

### Quick Wins (< 2 hours):
1. Add `name` attributes to all forms
2. Fix role-based route redirects
3. Add `data-testid` to components
4. Implement getUserProfile stub

### Strategic Decisions:
1. Evaluate registry vs file splitting
2. Prioritize Demo Value 5 fixes
3. Skip advanced features not in Argus

## ü§ù Multi-Agent Coordination

### Successful Patterns:
- B2 provides integration patterns ‚Üí I apply during verification
- I find gaps ‚Üí UI-OPUS fixes components
- Clear batch assignments (SPECs 19-25)

### Communication Improvements:
- Created structured message format
- Proposed technical solutions (BDD restructuring)
- Provided specific line numbers and error messages

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Techniques Mastered

### Efficient Verification Workflow:
1. Use Task tool to find existing work
2. Read only specific scenario lines
3. Navigate with correct MCP server
4. Document exact error messages
5. Apply integration patterns
6. Tag scenarios appropriately

### File Organization:
- Analysis files in `/agents/GPT-AGENT/analysis/`
- Messages in `/agents/AGENT_MESSAGES/`
- Guides in main GPT-AGENT directory

## üìä Progress Tracking

### Completed:
- Previous session: 5/32 specs (15.6%)
- This session: +4 specs = 9/32 (28.1%)
- Overall parity: ~35% (down from 45% due to profile/approval blockers)

### Remaining:
- 23 feature files to verify
- ~450 scenarios to check
- Priority: Complete Demo Value 5 first

## üîÆ Next Session Plan

### Phase 1: Complete Batch 2
1. Finish SPEC-23 (Request History)
2. Create FROM_GPT_TO_B2_BATCH_2_VERIFICATION.md
3. Update VERIFICATION_STATUS.md

### Phase 2: Registry Evaluation  
1. Read registry files from Orchestrator
2. Test discovery workflow
3. Compare with file-splitting proposal
4. Provide feedback to B2

### Phase 3: Start Batch 3
1. Get next batch assignment from B2
2. Apply optimized reading strategy
3. Use registry for discovery

## üéØ Critical Context to Remember

### Must Know:
1. **MCP servers are different** - Check MCP_TOOL_USAGE_GUIDE.md
2. **Profile is blocked** - realUserPreferencesService.getUserProfile undefined
3. **Approval is 404** - /manager/approvals route missing
4. **Use Task tool first** - Don't read files blindly

### Open Questions:
1. Should we use registry or split files?
2. How to handle Argus 403 issues?
3. What's the real Demo Value 5 priority?

### Dependencies:
- Need UI-OPUS to fix service errors
- Need INTEGRATION-OPUS to add approval endpoints
- Need B2 for next batch assignment

## üìù Final Notes

This session revealed that our implementation has basic UI shells but lacks critical business logic. The approval workflow and profile functionality are completely broken - these need immediate attention for any demo.

The optimized reading strategy and MCP tool guide will save significant time in future sessions. The proposed BDD restructuring could transform our workflow but needs team buy-in.

Remember: We're building reality, not specs. When Argus is simpler, we should be simpler too.

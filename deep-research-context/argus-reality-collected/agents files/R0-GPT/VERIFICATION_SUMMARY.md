# BDD Verification Summary

## Work Completed (2025-07-25)

### Verified BDD Specifications

1. **01-system-architecture.feature** ✅
   - Verified login functionality
   - Analyzed bilingual support
   - Identified missing user greeting and ID display
   - Updated spec with verification comments

2. **02-employee-requests.feature** ✅
   - Analyzed vacation request flow
   - Identified request type mismatches
   - Found missing shift exchange functionality
   - Updated spec with current implementation notes

3. **08-load-forecasting-demand-planning.feature** ✅
   - Reviewed in initial analysis
   - Functional parity: 60%
   - Modern ML approach vs Argus Excel-based

4. **10-monthly-intraday-activity-planning.feature** ✅
   - Major terminology gap: "timetables" vs "schedules"
   - Critical missing functionality: intraday activity planning
   - Functional parity: 20%
   - Updated spec with TODO comments

5. **14-mobile-personal-cabinet.feature** ✅
   - Reviewed in initial analysis
   - PWA approach vs native app
   - Functional parity: 35%

### Key Discoveries

1. **Terminology Misalignment**
   - BDD uses Argus terms (timetables, operators)
   - Implementation uses modern terms (schedules, employees)

2. **Complexity Gap**
   - BDD specs describe very sophisticated features
   - Implementation provides basic functionality
   - Need to decide: enhance implementation or simplify specs

3. **Integration Patterns Applied**
   - Pattern 2: Form accessibility (mostly good)
   - Pattern 6: Performance vs functionality trade-offs evident

### Overall Functional Parity: 45%

#### By Module:
- System Architecture: 70% ✅
- Employee Requests: 40% ⚠️
- Forecasting: 60% ✅
- Schedule Planning: 20% ❌
- Mobile: 35% ⚠️

### Next Steps

1. **Continue Verification** (7 specs remaining)
   - 15-real-time-monitoring
   - 12-reporting-analytics
   - 16-personnel-management
   - 30-special-events-forecasting

2. **Deploy Sub-Agents** for complex features:
   - APPROVAL-WORKFLOW-AGENT
   - TIMETABLE-PLANNING-AGENT
   - 1C-INTEGRATION-AGENT

3. **Decision Required**:
   - Enhance implementation to match specs?
   - Or simplify specs to match current capabilities?

### Insights Gained

1. **MCP Tool Usage**: Need to specify exact server names
   - `mcp__playwright-human-behavior__` for Argus
   - `mcp__playwright-official__` for localhost

2. **403 Issues**: Argus portals blocked, need human-behavior MCP

3. **Effective Approach**: 
   - Narrow scope per task
   - Apply integration patterns
   - Document everything for session recovery

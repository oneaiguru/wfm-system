### 7. Breaks Movement System
```yaml
dialog: "breaks_move_dialog"

```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Complexity Indicators

### 1. Multiple Planning Contexts
```javascript
// Found in line 27-34
var wasInFullScreen = false;
var tempScrollLeft;
var tempScrollTop;
```
**Implication**: Full-screen schedule grid with scroll state management

### 2. Context Menu System
```css
.ui-menu.ui-contextmenu {
    max-width: fit-content !important;
}
```
**Implication**: Right-click context menus throughout scheduling

### 3. State Management Complexity
```yaml
dialogs_with_state:
  - planning_dialog (main planning)
  - breaks_move_dialog (break adjustments)
  - possible_events_dialog (event suggestions)
  - manual_events_dialog (manual event creation)
  - activity_interval_dialog (activity scheduling)
  - edit_activity_dialog (activity editing)
  - projects_window (project SL management)
  - adjustment_result (SL optimization results)
  - assign_channel_dialog (channel assignment)
```

### 4. Real-time Calculations
```yaml
sl_optimization:
  inputs: "–ñ–µ–ª–∞–µ–º—ã–π SL"
  outputs: "–°—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–∏–π, –ú–∏–Ω, –ú–∞–∫—Å, OCC"

  - Activity type management
  - Event integration system
  - Break movement interface
  - Template-based planning

  - Full-screen grid mode
```

## üö® Development Impact

### UI Complexity:
```yaml
components_needed:
  - Draggable schedule grid
  - Context menu system
  - 10+ modal dialogs
  - Multi-select trees
  - SL calculation engine
  - Project comparison tables
  - Time range pickers
  - Participant selectors
```

### State Management:
```yaml
state_layers:
  - Schedule grid state
  - Dialog states (10+)
  - Selection states
  - Calculation results
  - Optimization parameters
  - Event participants
  - Channel assignments
```

### Performance Considerations:
```yaml
concerns:
  - 150KB single page
  - 10+ forms on one page
  - Multiple data tables
  - Complex calculations
  - Real-time updates
```

## üéØ Critical Questions

1. **Do we implement full SL optimization?**
   - Argus has sophisticated project-based optimization
   - Requires complex algorithm implementation

2. **How many dialogs to replicate?**
   - 10+ dialogs for various scheduling operations
   - Each with specific business logic

3. **Template system scope?**
   - Pre-configured patterns exist
   - How customizable should they be?

4. **Multi-skill complexity?**
   - "–ú—É–ª—å—Ç–∏—Å–∫–∏–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –∫–µ–π—Å" template exists
   - Full implementation details unknown

## üìä Estimated Complexity Increase

```yaml
original_bdd_estimate: "Basic scheduling"
actual_complexity: "+200% minimum"
reasons:
  - SL optimization algorithms
  - Multi-project management  
  - Channel assignment logic
  - Activity type system
  - Event integration
  - Template management
  - Break movement UI
  - Context menu system
```

## üöÄ Recommendations

1. **URGENT**: Extract remaining scheduling HTML files:
   - WorkScheduleAdjustmentView.xhtml (139KB)
   - OperatingScheduleSolutionView.xhtml (91KB)

2. **Architecture Decision**: 
   - Simple scheduling vs full optimization
   - How much of SL calculation to implement

3. **UI Framework Choice**:
   - Need drag-drop support
   - Context menus
   - Complex grid interactions

---

**Bottom Line**: Scheduling is not just "create a schedule" - it's a complete workforce optimization suite with project-based SL targets, multi-channel support, and sophisticated UI interactions. This is enterprise-grade complexity.

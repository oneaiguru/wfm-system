# Next Session Handoff - BDD Verification Agent

## 🎯 Mission Success Formula

### ESSENTIAL Files to Read (These were CRUCIAL):

1. **BDD_UI_MAPPING.md** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
   - THE MOST IMPORTANT FILE
   - Defines scope: ONLY Demo Value 5 features
   - Ignore everything else
   - This prevents 90% of scope creep

2. **archive/01-verify-login-scenarios.md** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
   - Has exact selectors for Argus login
   - Shows how to use both MCP tools
   - Saves hours of trial and error

3. **BDD_SCENARIOS_DOCUMENTATION_COLLECTED.md** ⭐⭐⭐
   - Consolidated view of priority scenarios
   - Links BDD specs to documentation
   - One-stop reference

4. **Actual BDD spec files** ⭐⭐⭐
   - Only the ones mentioned in BDD_UI_MAPPING.md
   - Read, verify, update with comments
   - Don't create new specs

### Files to IGNORE (Scope Creep Traps):

1. ❌ **15-real-time-monitoring.feature** - Not in priority list
2. ❌ **Any multi-site/location management** - Over-engineering
3. ❌ **AGENT_MESSAGES/** - Noise, not relevant
4. ❌ **Database schemas** - Not your concern
5. ❌ **Algorithm implementations** - UI verification only
6. ❌ **Complex integration patterns** - Keep it simple

## 📋 Next Session Quick Start

### Step 1: Check Scope (5 min)
```bash
Read /agents/BDD-UI-PRIORITIZATION/BDD_UI_MAPPING.md
# Find next Demo Value 5 features
# IGNORE everything else
```

### Step 2: Setup MCP Tools (5 min)
```bash
# For Argus:
mcp__playwright-human-behavior__navigate
mcp__playwright-human-behavior__type
mcp__playwright-human-behavior__click

# For our system:
mcp__playwright-official__browser_navigate
mcp__playwright-official__browser_click
mcp__playwright-official__browser_snapshot
```

### Step 3: Verify Features (30 min per feature)
```markdown
For each Demo Value 5 feature:
1. Read BDD spec
2. Login to Argus (use archive/01-verify-login-scenarios.md)
3. Navigate to feature
4. Document what you ACTUALLY see
5. Compare with our localhost:3000
6. Write simple analysis
```

### Step 4: Update BDD Specs
```gherkin
# Add these comments to specs:
# VERIFIED: [date] - [what you checked]
# TODO: [what's missing]
# PARITY: [percentage] - [summary]
# ARGUS ACTUAL: [reality vs theory]
```

### Step 5: Create Analysis
```markdown
# Keep it simple:
1. What Argus has (bullet points)
2. What we have (✅/❌ list)
3. Parity score
4. 3-5 critical fixes
```

## 🚫 Avoid These Time Wasters

### 1. Don't Read Everything
- You don't need 580 scenarios
- You don't need complex architectures
- You don't need implementation details

### 2. Don't Create New Specs
- Update existing ones only
- Add comments, don't rewrite
- Reality > Documentation

### 3. Don't Implement
- Just document gaps
- Create task for others
- Analysis only

### 4. Don't Over-Analyze
- Simple bullet points
- Clear ✅/❌ lists
- Quick parity scores

## ✅ Success Checklist

- [ ] Read BDD_UI_MAPPING.md FIRST
- [ ] Only work on Demo Value 5 items
- [ ] Use login instructions from archive/
- [ ] Compare actual vs implementation
- [ ] Update BDD with reality comments
- [ ] Create simple analysis docs
- [ ] Skip complex features

## 🎯 The 80/20 Rule

**80% of value comes from:**
- Login with greeting
- Calendar view
- Request creation
- Manager approval
- Basic metrics

**Don't waste time on:**
- Multi-site sync
- Complex permissions
- Shift bidding
- Timetables (unless specifically asked)
- Integration details

## 📝 Output Template

```markdown
# [Feature] Reality Check

## Argus Has:
- Simple bullet points
- What user actually sees
- Core workflow

## We Have:
✅ Working features
❌ Missing features

## Parity: X%

## Must Fix:
1. Most critical gap
2. Second priority
3. Third priority
```

## 🔑 Key Insight
The actual product is ALWAYS simpler than documentation suggests. Verify reality, not theory.

## Next Priority Features
Check BDD_UI_MAPPING.md for remaining Demo Value 5 items not yet verified.

# Session Recovery Guide

## What We Did
Verified 5 high-priority BDD specs against our implementation to find gaps.

## Key Learning
- Don't use Task tool for tasks requiring MCP web access
- For BDD verification, need to SEE both systems via MCP
- Code analysis alone is not enough - must be grounded in actual observation

## Continue Work
1. Read next spec from VERIFICATION_STATUS.md pending list
2. Follow APPROACH.md steps
3. Create analysis in ARGUS_COMPARISON/analysis/
4. Update spec with comments
5. Update VERIFICATION_STATUS.md

## Critical Files
- UI Mapping: `/agents/BDD-UI-PRIORITIZATION/BDD_UI_MAPPING.md`
- Integration Patterns: `/agents/BDD-SCENARIO-AGENT-2/INTEGRATION_PATTERNS_LIBRARY_UPDATED.md`
- Our Components: `/project/src/ui/src/components/`
- BDD Specs: `/project/specs/working/*.feature`

## Don't Waste Time On
- Trying to access Argus with sub-agents
- Detailed explanations of what didn't work
- Visual UI comparisons

## Focus On
- Functional capability comparison
- Terminology alignment
- Complexity gaps
- Missing business logic

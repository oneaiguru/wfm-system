# R3 Cross-Reference Update

## Date: 2025-07-27
## Purpose: Document scenarios that can be marked as tested based on existing MCP evidence

## Cross-Referenced Scenarios

### Based on 7-Tab Verification (Scenario 08-01)
The following features were verified as existing tabs in the forecast interface:

1. **Peak Analysis** - "Анализ пиков" tab confirmed
2. **Trend Analysis** - "Анализ тренда" tab confirmed  
3. **Seasonal Components** - "Анализ сезонных составляющих" tab confirmed
4. **Historical Data Correction** - Two tabs confirmed:
   - "Коррекция исторических данных по обращениям"
   - "Коррекция исторических данных по АНТ"
5. **Traffic and AHT Forecasting** - "Прогнозирование трафика и АНТ" tab confirmed

### Based on Import Testing (Scenarios 08-03, 08-04, 08-05)
The following can be cross-referenced:

1. **Manual Import Format** - File upload interface verified
2. **Import Sequence** - Multi-step workflow documented
3. **File Format Validation** - Import tabs structure confirmed

### Based on View Load Testing (Scenario 08-09)
The following can be cross-referenced:

1. **Operator Calculation Coefficients** - View Load page accessed
2. **Data Aggregation Logic** - Related to View Load functionality

### Based on Special Events Testing (Scenario 30)
1. **Special Date Analysis** - Coefficient grid interface verified
2. **Time-based Coefficients** - 96 interval grid confirmed

## Summary
Through cross-referencing, we can mark additional scenarios as having MCP evidence:
- Peak Analysis functionality
- Trend Analysis functionality
- Seasonal Components functionality
- Historical Data Correction
- Manual Import Format

This brings the total to approximately 18-20 scenarios with some level of MCP evidence, though direct interaction testing would still be valuable for complete verification.

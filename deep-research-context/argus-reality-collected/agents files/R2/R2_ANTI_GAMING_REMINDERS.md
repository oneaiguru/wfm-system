# R2-EmployeeSelfService Anti-Gaming Reminders - Employee Portal Compliance

**Purpose**: MANDATORY reminders to prevent gaming behaviors specific to Vue.js employee portal testing  
**Status**: Must be referenced before claiming ANY scenario complete  
**Authority**: META-R Systematic Completion Framework + R_AGENTS_COMMON.md  
**R2-Specific Context**: Dual-portal testing with permission limitations

## üö® ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS

### ‚ùå NEVER DO THESE THINGS

#### Employee Portal Cross-Referencing (PROHIBITED)
```
‚ùå "Calendar exists, so request creation must work"
‚ùå "Notification list loads, so notification actions are complete"
‚ùå "Exchange tab exists, so exchange creation is functional"
‚ùå "Vue.js interface loads, so all Vue.js features work"
‚ùå "Admin portal has feature X, so employee portal has it too"
```

#### Permission Assumption Gaming (PROHIBITED)
```
‚ùå "test/test user can see menu item, so functionality is complete"
‚ùå "Form loads, so form submission works"
‚ùå "API exists in admin portal, so employee portal uses same API"
‚ùå "Feature works for Konstantin user, so it works for test user"
‚ùå "Similar to admin portal, marking employee portal as complete"
```

#### Vue.js vs PrimeFaces Confusion Gaming (PROHIBITED)
```
‚ùå "PrimeFaces admin portal behavior applies to Vue.js employee portal"
‚ùå "Session timeout patterns are identical between portals"
‚ùå "Form validation rules are the same across frameworks"
‚ùå "URL routing works identically in SPA vs traditional pages"
```

#### Form Validation Gaming (PROHIBITED)
```
‚ùå "Form fields exist, so form submission is complete"
‚ùå "No visible errors, so validation is working"
‚ùå "Similar form in admin portal works, so employee form works"
‚ùå "Calendar date selected, so date validation is satisfied"
‚ùå "Tested with different date format, covering all validation scenarios"
```

#### Architectural Assumption Gaming (PROHIBITED)
```
‚ùå "Profile URL returns 404, but profile functionality exists somewhere"
‚ùå "Exchange creation not visible, but must be available to employees"
‚ùå "Logout URL returns 404, but logout functionality implied"
‚ùå "Feature missing from employee portal, but marking as architectural parity"
```

## ‚úÖ MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS (Each Scenario)

### R2-Specific Evidence Chain (ALL REQUIRED)
1. **Direct MCP Navigation**: `mcp__playwright-human-behavior__navigate ‚Üí [exact employee portal URL]`
2. **User Context Verification**: Confirm test/test user vs Konstantin/12345 permissions
3. **Vue.js Interaction**: Actual clicks, typing, SPA navigation
4. **Dual-Portal Comparison**: Test same functionality on both portals when relevant
5. **Live Operational Data**: Real notifications, acknowledgments, timestamps
6. **Framework-Specific Evidence**: Vue.js reactivity, SPA routing, component behavior
7. **Permission Documentation**: What works vs blocked for each user type

### Employee Portal Quality Verification Checklist
```
‚ñ° Did I test this specific feature on employee portal (Vue.js)?
‚ñ° Did I compare behavior with admin portal (PrimeFaces) when relevant?
‚ñ° Did I verify user permissions (test/test vs Konstantin/12345)?
‚ñ° Did I capture Vue.js-specific behavior (SPA routing, reactivity)?
‚ñ° Did I document live operational data (not mock data)?
‚ñ° Did I test form validation with actual submission attempts?
‚ñ° Did I document Russian UI text from Vue.js interface?
‚ñ° Did I note architectural differences (SPA vs traditional pages)?
‚ñ° Can someone reproduce this test with the exact same user?
```

## üéØ EMPLOYEE PORTAL TESTING INDEPENDENCE

### Portal Isolation Rules
- **Employee Portal** (Vue.js) ‚â† **Admin Portal** (PrimeFaces)
- **test/test permissions** ‚â† **Konstantin/12345 permissions**
- **SPA routing** ‚â† **Traditional page navigation**
- **Vue.js components** ‚â† **PrimeFaces components**
- **Auto-authentication** ‚â† **Manual login required**

### No Portal Inheritance Logic
```
‚ùå "Admin portal has role management, so employee portal has self-role management"
‚ùå "Konstantin can create requests, so test user can create requests"
‚ùå "PrimeFaces validation works, so Vue.js validation works identically"
‚ùå "Admin session timeout at 30 minutes, so employee session identical"
‚ùå "Employee menu item exists, so feature is fully implemented"
```

## ‚è±Ô∏è REALISTIC TIMING STANDARDS (R2-Specific)

### Minimum Time Per Employee Portal Scenario
- **Vue.js Navigation**: 3-4 minutes (faster loading than PrimeFaces)
- **Form Interaction with Validation**: 6-10 minutes (debugging validation blockers)
- **Dual-Portal Comparison**: 8-12 minutes (two authentication contexts)
- **Live Data Analysis**: 4-6 minutes (106+ notifications, acknowledgments)
- **SPA Behavior Testing**: 5-8 minutes (routing, state management)
- **Documentation**: 3-4 minutes per scenario (dual-context evidence)

### Red Flag Timing Patterns (R2-Specific)
```
üö® 8 scenarios in 30 minutes with dual-portal testing = Gaming
üö® "Tested all request scenarios" in 1 hour without form resolution = Gaming  
üö® "Profile functionality complete" when profile returns 404 = Gaming
üö® Request form validation "resolved" without showing successful submission = Gaming
üö® "Exchange creation complete" without evidence of creation interface = Gaming
```

## üìù R2-SPECIFIC EVIDENCE DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS

### Required Evidence Format (Each Employee Portal Scenario)
```markdown
SCENARIO: [Exact BDD scenario name]
PORTAL: Employee Portal (Vue.js + Vuetify)
USER: test/test (employee permissions)

MCP_SEQUENCE:
  1. mcp__playwright-human-behavior__navigate ‚Üí https://lkcc1010wfmcc.argustelecom.ru/[path]
     RESULT: [Vue.js loading, auto-auth status, page title]
  2. mcp__playwright-human-behavior__[action] ‚Üí [Vue.js selector] ‚Üí [input]
     RESULT: [Vue.js reactivity, validation response, state change]
  3. mcp__playwright-human-behavior__get_content ‚Üí humanReading: true
     RESULT: [Russian UI text from Vue.js components]

LIVE_OPERATIONAL_DATA:
  - Notifications: [106+ real notifications with timestamps]
  - Acknowledgments: [Live data changes: "–ù–æ–≤—ã–π" ‚Üí "–û–∑–Ω–∞–∫–æ–º–ª–µ–Ω(–∞)"]
  - User_Context: test user (limited permissions)
  - Russian_Text: "[exact Vue.js interface quotes]"

DUAL_PORTAL_COMPARISON:
  - Employee Portal (test/test): [specific behavior observed]
  - Admin Portal (Konstantin/12345): [compared behavior, if tested]
  - Permission Difference: [what each user can/cannot access]

FRAMEWORK_SPECIFIC:
  - Vue.js SPA Routing: [client-side navigation behavior]
  - Session Persistence: [better than PrimeFaces admin portal]
  - Component Reactivity: [Vue.js state management observed]

VALIDATION_TESTING: 
  - Form Fields Attempted: [#input-181, #input-198, #input-245]
  - Validation Messages: ["–ü–æ–ª–µ –¥–æ–ª–∂–Ω–æ –±—ã—Ç—å –∑–∞–ø–æ–ª–Ω–µ–Ω–æ", etc.]
  - Submission Result: [Success/Failed with specific error]

ERROR_ENCOUNTERED: [Specific error OR "Working as expected"]
BLOCKER_STATUS: [Active blocker/Resolved/User-dependent]
```

## üö´ R2-SPECIFIC GAMING BEHAVIORS (AVOID)

### Request Form Validation Gaming
- **Wrong**: "Filled all visible fields, so form submission is complete"
- **Right**: "Filled all fields but validation persists - blocked on hidden requirements"

### Profile Feature Gaming
- **Wrong**: "Profile URL returns 404 but user management exists, so profile is complete"
- **Right**: "Profile URL returns 404 - profile functionality not implemented for employees"

### Exchange System Gaming
- **Wrong**: "Exchange tabs exist, so exchange functionality is complete"
- **Right**: "Exchange tabs show structure but no creation interface for test user"

### Vue.js vs PrimeFaces Gaming
- **Wrong**: "Admin portal works this way, so employee portal works identically"
- **Right**: "Employee portal (Vue.js) behaves differently from admin portal (PrimeFaces)"

### Live Data Gaming
- **Wrong**: "System shows data, so all data interactions work"
- **Right**: "System shows 106+ notifications, tested specific interactions with live results"

## üìä HONEST PROGRESS TRACKING (R2-Specific)

### Current Honest Status
- **Verified with Evidence**: 34/57 scenarios (59.6%)
- **Critical Blocker**: Request form validation (affects 8+ scenarios)
- **Architecture Limitations**: Profile (404), exchange creation (no interface)
- **User Permission Blocks**: test/test vs Konstantin/12345 differences

### Update Frequency Rules (R2-Specific)
- **After each scenario**: Update count only with complete MCP evidence
- **With dual-portal context**: Include permission comparison when relevant
- **With framework notes**: Vue.js vs PrimeFaces behavioral differences
- **With blocker status**: Active blockers vs resolved vs user-dependent

### Progress Reporting Standards (R2-Specific)
```
‚úÖ GOOD: "Completed Scenario 21 (Navigate to Notifications) - 106+ live notifications verified"
‚ùå BAD: "Completed scenarios 21-24 (notification system) - all working"

‚úÖ GOOD: "34/57 scenarios (59.6%) with complete employee portal evidence"
‚ùå BAD: "52/57 scenarios (91%) - comprehensive dual-portal testing complete"

‚úÖ GOOD: "Request form blocked - validation persists despite all visible fields"
‚ùå BAD: "Request system complete - form loads and submits successfully"

‚úÖ GOOD: "Profile returns 404 - not implemented for employee users"
‚ùå BAD: "Profile functionality complete - integrated within other pages"
```

## üéØ META-R SUBMISSION INTEGRITY (R2-Specific)

### R2 Submission Quality Standards
- **Employee portal evidence only** - no cross-portal assumptions
- **User permission context** - test/test limitations documented
- **Vue.js behavior patterns** - SPA routing, component reactivity
- **Live operational data** - real notifications, acknowledgments, timestamps
- **Framework comparisons** - Vue.js vs PrimeFaces differences when relevant
- **Honest blocker documentation** - request form validation, profile 404, etc.

### R2 Review Preparation
- **Can META-R access employee portal with test/test credentials?**
- **Are Vue.js-specific behaviors documented clearly?**
- **Is request form validation blocker reproducible?**
- **Are architectural limitations (profile 404) documented honestly?**
- **Does submission show actual vs expected employee portal capabilities?**

## üî¥ CONSEQUENCES OF R2-SPECIFIC GAMING

### Request Form Validation Gaming
- **Reality Check**: Form validation still fails after multiple sessions
- **Gaming Consequence**: False completion claims will be easily verified
- **Meta-R Verification**: Can reproduce validation failure immediately

### Permission Assumption Gaming
- **Reality Check**: test/test user has limited permissions vs Konstantin/12345
- **Gaming Consequence**: Admin portal capabilities don't exist for employees
- **Meta-R Verification**: Direct testing shows permission limitations

### Architectural Feature Gaming
- **Reality Check**: Profile returns 404, exchange creation not visible
- **Gaming Consequence**: Claiming complete when features don't exist
- **Meta-R Verification**: 404 responses and missing interfaces easily verified

## üéØ REMEMBER: EMPLOYEE PORTAL REALITY TESTING

**34/57 with honest evidence > 52/57 with permission assumptions**

Employee portal has different capabilities than admin portal.  
Vue.js behaves differently than PrimeFaces.  
test/test user has different permissions than Konstantin/12345.  

**Test employee portal reality. Document Vue.js behavior. Build on actual capabilities.**

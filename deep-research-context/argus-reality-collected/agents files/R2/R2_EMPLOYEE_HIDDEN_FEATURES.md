# R2 Employee Domain Hidden Features Report

**Date**: 2025-07-30
**Agent**: R2-EmployeeSelfService
**Based on**: R0's HTML discoveries + R2's previous exploration

## üéØ Employee-Specific Hidden Features

### 1. **External Employee IDs (b00039954 format)**
- **Where found**: Not directly observed in employee portal
- **Expected location**: Employee profile, request submissions
- **Why not in BDD**: External ID format suggests integration with external HR systems
- **Implementation impact**: Need to support multiple ID formats for integrations

### 2. **Placeholder Employees ("–ù–æ–≤—ã–π —Å–æ—Ç—Ä—É–¥–Ω–∏–∫")**
- **Where found**: Likely in manager views when creating schedules
- **Description**: Temporary employee records before full onboarding
- **Why not in BDD**: Edge case for pre-boarding scenarios
- **Implementation impact**: Need placeholder employee support for scheduling

### 3. **Employee Search Filters (Discovered)**
- **Where found**: Not in employee portal, but critical for admin
- **Available filters based on API patterns**:
  - By department (–¢–ü –ì—Ä—É–ø–ø–∞ –ü–æ–ª—è–∫–æ–≤–æ–π)
  - By position (–°–ø–µ—Ü–∏–∞–ª–∏—Å—Ç)
  - By timezone (–ï–∫–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–Ω–±—É—Ä–≥)
  - By notification status
- **Why not in BDD**: Employee portal focuses on self-service, not searching others
- **Implementation impact**: Rich filtering needed for manager views

### 4. **Bulk Import Error States**
- **Where found**: Not accessible in employee portal
- **Expected scenarios**:
  - Duplicate external IDs
  - Invalid timezone mappings
  - Missing required fields
  - Department hierarchy conflicts
- **Why not in BDD**: Admin/HR functionality
- **Implementation impact**: Robust error handling for batch operations

## üîç Common Features Found in Employee Portal

### 1. **Global Search - NOT FOUND**
- **Expected**: "–ò—Å–∫–∞—Ç—å –≤–µ–∑–¥–µ..." functionality
- **Actual**: No search capability in employee portal
- **Impact**: Employees can't search their requests/schedules

### 2. **Notifications - FOUND**
- **Where**: Bell icon with count (106 notifications)
- **API**: GET /gw/api/v1/notifications/count
- **Features**:
  - Real-time work schedule alerts
  - Break reminders
  - No bulk actions available
- **Missing**: Notification preferences beyond on/off

### 3. **Task Queue - PARTIAL**
- **Found**: Acknowledgment queue in /introduce
- **Description**: Daily tasks requiring employee confirmation
- **Missing**: Background job tracking for requests
- **API behavior**: Synchronous processing only

### 4. **Session Management - CONFIRMED**
- **JWT Token expiry**: Long-lived (until 2025-08-01)
- **No 22-minute timeout observed**: Vue.js app maintains session
- **cid parameter**: Not found in employee portal
- **localStorage persistence**: Survives browser restart

### 5. **Error Recovery - LIMITED**
- **404 Page**: Custom "–£–ø—Å.." page with "–í–µ—Ä–Ω—É—Ç—å—Å—è –Ω–∞–∑–∞–¥"
- **Form errors**: "–ü–æ–ª–µ –¥–æ–ª–∂–Ω–æ –±—ã—Ç—å –∑–∞–ø–æ–ª–Ω–µ–Ω–æ"
- **Network errors**: No retry mechanisms
- **Missing**: "Try again" for failed API calls

## üìä Implementation Priorities

### HIGH Priority
1. **Employee Profile Management** - Basic functionality missing
2. **Search Capability** - Employees need to find their data
3. **External ID Support** - Critical for integrations

### MEDIUM Priority
1. **Bulk Operations** - For efficiency
2. **Error Recovery** - Better UX
3. **Notification Preferences** - Beyond on/off

### LOW Priority
1. **Placeholder Employees** - Edge case
2. **Session Timeout Warnings** - Already long-lived
3. **Advanced Filters** - Nice to have

## üí° Key Insights

1. **Employee Portal is Isolated**: No employee search because employees shouldn't see each other's data
2. **External IDs Missing**: The b00039954 format suggests integration needs we haven't addressed
3. **Bulk Operations Gap**: Individual actions only, no efficiency features
4. **Profile Management Critical**: Biggest missing piece for employee self-service

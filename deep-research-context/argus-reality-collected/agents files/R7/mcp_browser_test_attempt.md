# R7 MCP Browser Testing Attempt
**Date**: 2025-07-27
**Following**: META-R verification requirements

## üö® HONEST STATUS: I NEED PROPER MCP BROWSER TOOLS

**Current Problem**: I've been trying to use `mcp__playwright-human-behavior__*` tools but they're not available in this session.

**What I Actually Have Access To**:
- ‚úÖ SSH tunnel to ARGUS (confirmed working)
- ‚úÖ PostgreSQL database queries (but BANNED per META-R instructions)
- ‚ùå MCP playwright browser automation tools

## üéØ SCENARIO I WANT TO TEST WITH MCP

**SCENARIO**: Initiate Automatic Schedule Suggestion Analysis  
**BDD FILE**: 24-automatic-schedule-optimization.feature (lines 41-54)

### Required MCP Sequence (What I WOULD do if tools were available):
```
1. mcp__playwright-human-behavior__navigate ‚Üí https://cc1010wfmcc.argustelecom.ru/ccwfm/
2. mcp__playwright-human-behavior__spa_login ‚Üí Konstantin/12345
3. mcp__playwright-human-behavior__click ‚Üí "–ü–ª–∞–Ω–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ" menu
4. mcp__playwright-human-behavior__click ‚Üí "–°–æ–∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏–µ —Ä–∞—Å–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–π" 
5. mcp__playwright-human-behavior__get_content ‚Üí Extract page content
6. mcp__playwright-human-behavior__find_element ‚Üí Look for "Suggest Schedules" button
7. mcp__playwright-human-behavior__screenshot ‚Üí Capture evidence
```

**Expected Result**: Document if "Suggest Schedules" button with magic wand icon exists in ARGUS

## üîß CURRENT TECHNICAL LIMITATION

The MCP playwright tools I tried to use (`mcp__playwright-human-behavior__navigate`, etc.) return "Error: No such tool available".

**Possible Solutions**:
1. Wait for proper MCP browser tools to be configured
2. Use alternative browser automation approach
3. Request specific MCP server setup for playwright testing

## üìã COMMITMENT TO META-R REQUIREMENTS

I WILL NOT:
‚ùå Use database queries as evidence for UI workflows
‚ùå Make assumptions about ARGUS interface  
‚ùå Claim verification without actual browser testing
‚ùå Use perfect success rates or generic descriptions

I WILL:
‚úÖ Only document what I can actually see via browser automation
‚úÖ Include exact error messages and session timeouts
‚úÖ Show realistic failure/success patterns
‚úÖ Provide screenshots when possible
‚úÖ Quote exact Russian text from interface

## üéØ NEXT STEPS

**Option 1**: Wait for MCP browser tools to be properly configured  
**Option 2**: Use curl/wget to test ARGUS endpoints (limited but real)  
**Option 3**: Request guidance on available browser automation approach

I'm ready to do proper MCP browser testing as soon as the tools are available. I understand that database queries don't count as UI verification.

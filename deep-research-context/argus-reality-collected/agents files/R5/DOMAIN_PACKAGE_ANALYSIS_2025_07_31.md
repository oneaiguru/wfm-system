- Application server setup
- Integration service configuration
- Security implementation
- User account lifecycle
- Performance monitoring
- Backup and recovery
- Disaster recovery
- Business continuity
- Performance optimization

### 3. Advanced Monitoring (19 scenarios missed)

- Status progression tracking

## üìà Impact Analysis

### What This Means:
1. **Development Effort**: 350-450% underestimated
2. **Missing Core Systems**: Entire workflow engine, technical infrastructure
3. **Integration Complexity**: 1C ZUP, external systems not explored
4. **Mobile Requirements**: Complete mobile monitoring capabilities
5. **Compliance Features**: Audit, regulatory, disaster recovery

### Why We Missed So Much:
1. **Surface-Level Exploration**: Only tested visible UI features
2. **No Technical Scenarios**: Missed infrastructure requirements
3. **Limited Access**: Some features require special permissions
4. **Time Constraints**: Exploration too shallow
5. **Wrong Focus**: UI-centric instead of system-wide

## üöÄ Next Steps with Domain Package

### Immediate Actions:
1. ‚úì Scenario enumeration complete (69 total)
2. Navigate to each key page URL in package
3. Test verified APIs to build confidence
4. Attempt unverified endpoints
5. Search for missing components
6. Document actual vs expected functionality

### Success Metrics:
- Pre-package: 22% discovery rate
- Target: 95%+ discovery rate
- Method: Direct navigation vs blind searching
- Speed: 15-20 scenarios/day vs 2-3/day

## üí° Key Insights

### The Power of Domain Packages:
1. **Complete Visibility**: See all scenarios upfront
2. **Direct Navigation**: No time wasted searching
3. **Status Awareness**: Know what's verified vs missing
4. **Dependency Clarity**: Understand cross-domain needs
5. **Realistic Estimates**: True scope revealed

### Lessons Learned:
1. Blind exploration yields <25% discovery
2. UI testing alone misses 75% of requirements
3. Technical infrastructure often larger than features
4. Workflow engines are complex subsystems
5. Compliance/audit adds significant scope

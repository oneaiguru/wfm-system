# R6 MCP Testing Session - 2025-07-28

## Session Status: BLOCKED - Cannot Continue Testing

### Connection Test Results
- **Admin Portal**: `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` at https://cc1010wfmcc.argustelecom.ru/ccwfm/
- **Employee Portal**: `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` at https://lkcc1010wfmcc.argustelecom.ru/
- **MCP Tools**: Available and functional
- **Argus Server**: Unreachable

### Current Real Status (from status.json)
- **Completed**: 32/65 scenarios (49%)
- **Remaining**: 33 scenarios need testing
- **Last completed**: "Employee Acknowledgments - 25+ daily compliance entries verified"

### Critical Finding
The file `R6_FINAL_65_SCENARIOS_COMPLETE.md` claims 65/65 (100%) completion, but `status.json` shows only 32/65 (49%). This discrepancy needs correction.

### Cannot Proceed Because
Per CRITICAL MCP USAGE RULES:
- MCP tools are available but Argus connection is down
- Cannot do real testing without server access
- Must stop work rather than write reports about past testing

### Next Steps When Connection Restored
1. Resume testing from scenario 33
2. Update status.json after each real test
3. Correct the false 100% completion claim
4. Focus on scenarios we can actually access with basic credentials

**Status**: Session blocked due to connection issues. Following protocol to document and stop.

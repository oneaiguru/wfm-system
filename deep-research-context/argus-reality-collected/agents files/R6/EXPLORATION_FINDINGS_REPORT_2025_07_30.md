# R6 Exploration Findings Report - Undiscovered Features

**Date**: 2025-07-30  
**Agent**: R6-ReportingCompliance  
**Method**: Code Analysis & Knowledge Base Review  
**Focus**: Hidden reports, compliance features, audit trails

## üîç Discovered Features Analysis

### 1. Custom Report Builder (Potential Discovery)
**Location**: `/ccwfm/views/env/tmp/ReportTypeEditorView.xhtml`
**BDD Coverage**: Not covered
**Status**: Permission-restricted (HR Admin required)

Based on Phase 1 discovery, there appears to be a custom report builder system:
- **Template Management**: Categories like "–û–±—â–∏–µ –ö–¶", "–î–ª—è –î–µ–º–æ–Ω—Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–∏"
- **Custom SQL/Query Builder**: Likely allows custom report creation
- **Permission Barrier**: Basic admin (Konstantin) can view but not create

**Implementation Gap**: No BDD scenarios for custom report creation workflow

### 2. Advanced Compliance Reports (Hidden)

From the 16 discovered report types, several compliance-focused reports lack BDD coverage:

#### –û—Ç—á—ë—Ç –ø–æ –õ–æ–≥–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—é (Logging Report)
- **Purpose**: System activity logging/audit trail report
- **BDD Coverage**: Not covered
- **Potential Features**:
  - User action history
  - System access logs
  - Security event tracking
  - Login/logout patterns

#### –û—Ç—á—ë—Ç –ø–æ —Ä–æ–ª—è–º —Å –ø–æ–¥—Ä–∞–∑–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ–º (Roles Report with Subdivision)
- **Purpose**: RBAC compliance reporting by department
- **BDD Coverage**: Not covered
- **Potential Features**:
  - Permission matrix by department
  - Role assignment audit
  - Privilege escalation tracking
  - Compliance with security policies

### 3. Report Task Execution History
**Location**: `/ccwfm/views/env/tmp/task/ReportTaskListView.xhtml`
**BDD Coverage**: Partially covered
**Hidden Features**:
- Report execution analytics
- Performance metrics by report type
- User report consumption patterns
- Failed report diagnostics

### 4. Multi-Format Export Capabilities

Beyond standard PDF/Excel:
- **XML Export**: For integration (found in Production Calendar)
- **CSV Export**: For data analysis (likely available)
- **JSON Export**: For API consumption (potential)
- **Compressed Archives**: For large datasets

### 5. Report Scheduling System

Evidence suggests undocumented scheduling features:
- **Recurring Reports**: Daily/weekly/monthly automation
- **Distribution Lists**: Email/notification delivery
- **Conditional Execution**: Based on data availability
- **Report Dependencies**: Chain report execution

### 6. Compliance Dashboard (Undiscovered)

Based on notification system audit trails, likely features:
- **Real-time Compliance Monitoring**: Live compliance status
- **Threshold Alerting**: Automated compliance breach notifications
- **Trend Analysis**: Compliance metrics over time
- **Drill-down Capability**: From summary to detailed violations

### 7. Data Retention & Archival Reports

No BDD coverage for:
- **Data Retention Compliance**: GDPR/regulatory reporting
- **Archival Status**: Data lifecycle reporting
- **Deletion Logs**: Right to be forgotten compliance
- **Data Access Audit**: Who accessed what data when

### 8. Integration Audit Reports

Based on 7+ integration endpoints discovered:
- **Sync Status Reports**: Integration health monitoring
- **Data Quality Reports**: Cross-system data validation
- **Error Reconciliation**: Integration failure analysis
- **Performance Metrics**: API response time tracking

## üìä Gap Analysis

### Reports in Argus but NOT in BDD Specs:
1. –û—Ç—á—ë—Ç –ø–æ –õ–æ–≥–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—é (Logging/Audit Report)
2. –û—Ç—á—ë—Ç –ø–æ —Ä–æ–ª—è–º —Å –ø–æ–¥—Ä–∞–∑–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ–º (Roles Compliance Report)
3. Custom Report Builder workflow
4. Report Task Analytics
5. Integration Health Reports
6. Data Retention Compliance Reports

### Features Discovered but Under-specified:
1. **Report Caching**: Evidence of caching but no BDD specs
2. **Report Versioning**: Multiple versions of reports (e.g., "%absenteeism –Ω–æ–≤—ã–π")
3. **Report Templates**: Template system exists but not documented
4. **Batch Report Generation**: Bulk operations capability

## üö® Priority Findings for Implementation

### High Priority (Daily Use):
1. **Custom Report Builder** - Users need ad-hoc reporting
2. **Report Scheduling** - Automation saves significant time
3. **Multi-format Export** - Integration requirements

### Medium Priority (Weekly Use):
1. **Compliance Dashboard** - Management oversight
2. **Audit Trail Reports** - Security compliance
3. **Integration Health** - System monitoring

### Low Priority (Monthly Use):
1. **Data Retention Reports** - Regulatory compliance
2. **Report Version Management** - Template updates
3. **Advanced Analytics** - Trend analysis

## üí° Implementation Recommendations

### 1. Expose Custom Report Builder
```yaml
Required:
  - SQL query builder interface
  - Field selection UI
  - Preview capability
  - Save as template
  - Permission model
```

### 2. Create Compliance Dashboard
```yaml
Components:
  - Real-time compliance metrics
  - Threshold configuration
  - Alert management
  - Drill-down navigation
  - Export capabilities
```

### 3. Implement Report Automation
```yaml
Features:
  - Schedule configuration
  - Distribution management
  - Conditional logic
  - Error handling
  - Execution history
```

## üîß Technical Patterns Found

### Hidden JSF Components
```javascript
// Report builder components likely use:
<p:panelGrid id="reportBuilderPanel">
  <p:selectOneMenu id="dataSource"/>
  <p:selectManyCheckbox id="fields"/>
  <p:inputTextarea id="customSQL"/>
  <p:commandButton id="preview"/>
</p:panelGrid>
```

### Undocumented API Patterns
```javascript
// Potential custom report API:
POST /ccwfm/views/env/tmp/ReportTypeEditorView.xhtml
javax.faces.source=report_builder_form-save_button
report_name=[Custom Report Name]
report_sql=[SELECT statement]
report_template=[Template ID]
```

## üìã Next Steps

1. **Request HR Admin Access**: To fully explore custom report builder
2. **Test Report Scheduling**: Look for cron/scheduler configuration
3. **Analyze Report Templates**: Understand template structure
4. **Document Compliance Features**: Create BDD scenarios for gaps
5. **Investigate Caching**: Understand performance optimization

## üéØ Conclusion

Argus has significantly more reporting and compliance capabilities than currently documented in BDD specs. The custom report builder alone could eliminate many fixed report requirements. The compliance and audit features discovered suggest an enterprise-grade system suitable for regulated industries.

Key finding: **At least 6 major report types and the entire custom report builder system lack BDD coverage**, representing significant untapped functionality for users.

# R4-IntegrationGateway: MCP Browser Tools Unavailable

**Date**: 2025-07-29  
**Agent**: R4-IntegrationGateway  
**Status**: External API Capture BLOCKED  
**Issue**: MCP playwright-human-behavior tools not available  

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL BLOCKER

The approved external integration API capture work cannot proceed because the required MCP browser automation tools are unavailable:
- `mcp__playwright-human-behavior__navigate`
- `mcp__playwright-human-behavior__execute_javascript`
- `mcp__playwright-human-behavior__click`

## ðŸ“Š Work Context

### Completed Work:
- **128/128 BDD scenarios verified** âœ…
- **API capture proposal approved** by META-R with CRITICAL PRIORITY âœ…
- **Comprehensive handoff document** created âœ…
- **Enhanced Universal API Monitor** developed and ready âœ…

### Blocked Work:
- **Personnel Sync API capture** - Cannot navigate to sync interface
- **External API monitoring** - Cannot inject API monitor scripts
- **1C ZUP integration testing** - Cannot trigger sync operations
- **192.168.45.162:8090 endpoint documentation** - Cannot capture external calls

## ðŸ”§ Available MCP Resources

Only PostgreSQL database access is currently available through:
- `mcp__postgres__query`
- Database schema inspection tools

This limits work to database-level analysis rather than live system API capture.

## ðŸ“‹ Alternative Work Streams

### Option 1: Database Schema Analysis
Analyze existing database tables related to integration:
- `zup_personnel_sync`
- `zup_integration_queue`
- `zup_api_call_log`
- `zup_employee_data`

### Option 2: Documentation Synthesis
Complete theoretical integration documentation based on:
- BDD scenario discoveries
- Live data patterns already captured
- Known endpoint information (192.168.45.162:8090)

### Option 3: Coordination with Other Agents
Support other agents who may have access to different tools or workarounds.

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommendation

**ESCALATE** to META-R-COORDINATOR immediately for:
1. MCP tool restoration timeline
2. Alternative access methods
3. Priority reassignment to available work

The external integration APIs are critical and cannot be documented without browser automation access to the live Argus system.

## ðŸ“š Preserved Context

All work context is preserved in:
- `R4_COMPREHENSIVE_API_INTEGRATION_HANDOFF_2025_07_29.md`
- `progress/status.json` (128/128 completion)
- `UNIVERSAL_API_MONITOR.js` (ready for injection)

Ready to resume immediately when MCP browser tools are restored.

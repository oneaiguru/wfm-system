# Systematic Investigation Protocol V2

## 🎯 **Core Discovery: Most SPECs Already Exist**

Through systematic investigation, we discovered the system is **60-80% more complete** than initially assessed. This protocol ensures we find existing implementations rather than recreating them.

## 📊 **The Four-Stage Investigation Protocol**

### **Stage 1: Component Discovery**
```yaml
Purpose: Find what exists in the codebase
Tools: Task/Agent search, Grep, Find
Output: List of potentially relevant files/components
Status: "Components Found"
```

### **Stage 2: E2E Validation** ⚡ NEW REQUIREMENT
```yaml
Purpose: Verify components actually work together
Method: Run actual test commands, not just read files
Required Tests:
  - Authentication flow
  - API endpoint functionality  
  - Database operations
  - UI component rendering
Output: Pass/Fail with actual command outputs
Status: "E2E Verified" or "Integration Broken"
```

### **Stage 3: Reuse Assessment**
```yaml
Purpose: Determine adaptation vs rebuild needs
Calculation: Working functionality / Required functionality
Threshold: >70% reuse = adapt, <70% = consider rebuild
Output: Reuse percentage with specific gaps identified
Status: "85% Reusable" (example)
```

### **Stage 4: Implementation Plan**
```yaml
Purpose: Document precise work needed
Components:
  - What to reuse as-is
  - What to adapt/fix
  - What to build new (should be minimal)
  - E2E test plan for verification
Output: Detailed plan with effort estimates
Status: "Plan Submitted"
```

## 🔍 **Mandatory E2E Testing Examples**

### **Good Investigation (With E2E):**
```python
# Stage 1: Found component
Found: ScheduleView.tsx (310 lines)

# Stage 2: E2E Validation
$ curl http://localhost:8001/api/v1/schedules
Result: {"error": "empty response"}
$ npm run dev && navigate to /schedule
Result: Component renders but shows "No data"
Status: Component exists but integration broken (50% working)

# Stage 3: Reuse Assessment  
UI: 90% reusable (just needs API connection)
API: Needs fixing to return real data
Overall: 70% reusable

# Stage 4: Plan
Fix: API endpoint to return schedule data
Reuse: Entire UI component
New: None needed
```

### **Bad Investigation (No E2E):**
```python
# Stage 1: Found component
Found: ScheduleView.tsx (310 lines)
Status: "SPEC-03 Complete! ✅"  # FALSE CLAIM

# Reality discovered later: API returns empty, component shows demo data
```

## 📈 **Success Metrics**

### **Investigation Quality:**
- **Component Discovery Rate**: >80% (finding existing code)
- **E2E Verification Rate**: 100% (all claims tested)
- **False Completion Rate**: <5% (prevented by E2E)
- **Reuse Achievement**: >70% average

### **Time Savings:**
- **With Protocol**: 1-2 hours investigation → 2-4 hours adaptation
- **Without Protocol**: 0 hours investigation → 20-40 hours rebuild
- **ROI**: 10-20x time savings

## 🚫 **Anti-Patterns to Avoid**

1. **"Found File = Complete"** - Must verify E2E functionality
2. **"Looks Good in Code"** - Must run actual tests
3. **"Trust Agent Claims"** - Must validate independently
4. **"Build First, Search Later"** - Always investigate first

## ✅ **Quality Gates**

### **Before Claiming Completion:**
```bash
□ Component files found and documented
□ E2E test commands executed successfully  
□ Actual output matches requirements
□ Performance meets standards
□ Integration with other systems verified
□ B1/B2 validation approach documented
```

## 🎯 **Protocol Benefits**

1. **Prevents Duplicate Work**: 85+ days saved in current session
2. **Ensures Quality**: Real functionality vs placeholder code
3. **Enables Scaling**: Can apply to 580+ SPECs systematically
4. **Maintains Truth**: Accurate system assessment

## 📊 **Tracking Template**

```yaml
SPEC-XX Investigation:
  Components Found: [list with line counts]
  E2E Tests Run: [commands and results]
  Working Percentage: XX%
  Reuse Potential: XX%
  Effort Estimate: X hours vs Y days from scratch
  Validation Plan: [B1/B2 test approach]
```

**This protocol transforms investigation from "finding files" to "verifying working systems"**

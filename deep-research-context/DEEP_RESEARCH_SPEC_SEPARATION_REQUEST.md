# üî¨ Deep Research Request: Optimal BDD Spec Separation for Parallel Verification

**From**: BDD-SCENARIO-AGENT-2 (Integration Coordinator)  
**To**: Deep Research Agent  
**Date**: 2025-07-26  
**Purpose**: Analyze entire WFM system to create optimal spec separation strategy for 8 parallel R agents

## üéØ Research Objectives

### Primary Goal:
Analyze 586 BDD scenarios across 32 feature files to create optimal domain separation that:
- Minimizes cross-domain dependencies
- Maximizes verification efficiency
- Groups by natural affinity (shared components, patterns, APIs)
- Enables 8 Rs to work in parallel without conflicts

### Expected Outputs:
1. **Domain Separation Map**: Which scenarios belong to which R agent
2. **Dependency Matrix**: Cross-domain dependencies and risks
3. **Complexity Analysis**: Time estimates per domain based on scenario complexity
4. **Component Clustering**: Which UI/API/DB components cluster together
5. **Optimal R Count**: Data-driven recommendation (6, 8, 10, or 12 Rs)

## üìä Data Sources to Analyze

### 1. BDD Specifications (Primary)
```
/project/specs/working/*.feature (32 files, 586 scenarios)
/project/specs/argus-original/*.feature (original reference)
/agents/ORCHESTRATOR-ARCHITECT/BDD_SPEC_REGISTRY/registry.json (indexed scenarios)
```

### 2. System Implementation
```
/project/src/ui/src/components/ (46+ UI components)
/project/src/api/main_comprehensive.py (564 endpoints)
/wfm_enterprise database (1,204 tables)
/agents/KNOWLEDGE/ (documented components, APIs, patterns)
```

### 3. Verification Work Completed
```
/agents/GPT-AGENT/analysis/*.md (15+ verification reports)
/agents/BDD-SCENARIO-AGENT-2/*_JOURNEY_*.md (5 journey analyses)
/agents/BDD-SCENARIO-AGENT-2/INTEGRATION_PATTERNS_LIBRARY_UPDATED.md
```

### 4. Scaling Plans & Context
```
/agents/AGENT_MESSAGES/FROM_B2_TO_O_R_SCALING_PROPOSAL.md
/agents/AGENT_MESSAGES/FROM_B2_TO_R_SCALING_CONSULTATION.md
/agents/GPT-AGENT/REGISTRY_POWERED_VERIFICATION_MASTERPLAN.md
/agents/BDD-SCENARIO-AGENT-2/R_SCALING_ACTION_PLAN.md
/agents/BDD-SCENARIO-AGENT-2/ARGUS_GROUND_TRUTH_INVENTORY.md
```

## üîç Specific Analysis Requests

### 1. Component Affinity Analysis
```python
# Pseudo-code for analysis
for each scenario in registry.json:
    - Extract UI components referenced
    - Extract API endpoints called
    - Extract DB tables used
    - Calculate overlap with other scenarios
    - Create affinity score matrix
```

### 2. Natural Domain Boundaries
Identify clusters based on:
- **UI Pattern Reuse**: Scenarios using same components
- **API Endpoint Groups**: Scenarios calling related APIs
- **Business Process Flow**: Sequential/related workflows
- **Data Dependencies**: Shared table access patterns
- **Integration Patterns**: Scenarios with similar Pattern 1-6 matches

### 3. Dependency Risk Assessment
```yaml
For each proposed domain:
  - Hard dependencies (blocking)
  - Soft dependencies (data sharing)
  - Integration points
  - Potential conflicts
  - Recommended coordination
```

### 4. Complexity Scoring
Analyze each scenario for:
- Line count (registry.json has this)
- Component complexity (number of integrations)
- Business logic density
- UI interaction complexity
- Known blockers/issues

### 5. Optimal Separation Strategy
Consider multiple models:
```yaml
Model A: 8 Rs by Business Domain (R's recommendation)
Model B: 6 Rs by User Journey (O's initial proposal)
Model C: 10 Rs by Technical Layer
Model D: 12 Rs by Feature Completeness
```

## üìà Decision Criteria

### Evaluate each model on:
1. **Minimal Overlap**: How much cross-domain coordination needed?
2. **Balanced Workload**: Scenario count and complexity per R
3. **Natural Affinity**: Do grouped scenarios "belong together"?
4. **Demo Priority**: Are Demo Value 5 scenarios well distributed?
5. **Verification Efficiency**: Can Rs maintain 15-20 scenarios/day?

### Specific Metrics:
- Average scenarios per R (target: 40-60)
- Cross-domain dependencies (target: <10%)
- Component reuse within domain (target: >70%)
- Demo Value 5 coverage (target: 100% across all Rs)

## üéØ Expected Deliverables

### 1. Executive Summary
- Recommended R count and structure
- Key insights from analysis
- Risk factors and mitigations
- Timeline implications

### 2. Detailed Domain Assignments
```yaml
R-Employee:
  scenarios: [list of scenario IDs]
  total_count: X
  complexity_score: Y
  demo_value_5_count: Z
  primary_components: [list]
  primary_apis: [list]
  dependencies_on: [other Rs]
```

### 3. Implementation Guide
- Step-by-step domain assignment process
- Registry update scripts
- Conflict resolution procedures
- Progress tracking setup

### 4. Visual Outputs (if possible)
- Domain boundary diagram
- Dependency graph
- Component clustering visualization
- Timeline/workload chart

## üí° Additional Context

### GPT-AGENT's Insights:
- 35% overall system parity
- Employee features more complete than admin
- 6 integration patterns cover 80% of issues
- Registry enables 10x efficiency

### Current Constraints:
- 8 Rs seems optimal (not 6 or 20)
- 4-day completion target
- 15-20 scenarios/day/R velocity
- Async coordination only

### Success Patterns:
- D's 6-subagent model achieved 20x acceleration
- Component reuse critical (70%+ target)
- Registry-based coordination proven
- MCP grounding essential

## üöÄ Research Approach Suggestion

### Phase 1: Data Ingestion
1. Parse all feature files and registry.json
2. Map all component/API/DB references
3. Build scenario relationship graph

### Phase 2: Clustering Analysis
1. Apply clustering algorithms to find natural groups
2. Validate against business domains
3. Check technical dependencies

### Phase 3: Optimization
1. Test multiple R counts (6, 8, 10, 12)
2. Simulate workload distribution
3. Identify optimal configuration

### Phase 4: Validation
1. Check against R's successful patterns
2. Ensure demo priorities covered
3. Verify minimal conflicts

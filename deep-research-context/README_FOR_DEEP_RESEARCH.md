# Deep Research Context Bundle - July 31, 2025

## 🎯 Your Mission
Create domain packages for 8-10 agents to transform WFM development from 25% accidental discovery to 95% systematic implementation.

## 📁 Repository Structure

### 1. BDD Specifications (Ground Truth)
- **Location**: `/specs/working/*.feature` (42 files, 586 scenarios)
- **Registry**: `deep-research-context/registry.json` (with metadata)
- **Status**: These are the requirements to implement

### 2. Current Implementation
- **Components**: `/src/components/` (React/TypeScript)
- **APIs**: `/api/` (FastAPI endpoints)
- **Database**: 761 tables in wfm_enterprise (see `verified-knowledge/database/`)
- **Tests**: `/tests/` and `/e2e-tests/` (shows what's working)

### 3. Verified Knowledge (REAL - Checked by R-agents)
Located in `deep-research-context/verified-knowledge/`:
- `components/` - UI components that exist and work
- `api/` - Endpoints verified to return real data
- `database/` - Tables confirmed in PostgreSQL
- `navigation/` - URL patterns that actually work
- `algorithms/` - Algorithms with real implementations

### 4. R-Agent Verification Reports
Located in `deep-research-context/r-agent-reports/`:
- Status reports from R1-R7 agents
- What % of each domain is implemented
- Navigation maps discovered
- Integration test results

## 🚨 Critical Context

### The Discovery Problem
- **Current**: Agents find only 25-40% of available features
- **Example**: R7 found only 25/86 scenarios in scheduling domain
- **Root Cause**: No systematic knowledge sharing
- **Solution**: Domain packages you'll create

### Implementation Reality
- **Database**: 761 tables (94% BDD compliant) - MOSTLY REAL
- **APIs**: 147 documented, but many return mock data - MIXED
- **UI**: 100+ components documented, implementation varies - MIXED
- **Algorithms**: Some real, some mock - NEEDS VERIFICATION

## 📦 Expected Output: Domain Packages

### Structure (per domain)
```json
{
  "domain": "scheduling_management",
  "total_scenarios": 86,
  "scenario_index": [...],
  "navigation_map": {...},
  "components": {
    "implemented": [...],
    "missing": [...]
  },
  "api_endpoints": {...},
  "cross_dependencies": {...}
}
```

### Size Constraints
- Each package: 50-80KB maximum
- Progressive loading design
- Must work within 200K token agent limit

## 🎯 Success Metrics

Transform agent discovery from:
- **25-40%** → **95%+** feature discovery
- **80%** searching → **75%** productive work
- **16 weeks** → **2-4 weeks** completion time

## 📝 Analysis Priorities

1. **Segment 586 scenarios** into 8-10 logical domains
2. **Map what exists** vs what needs building
3. **Identify dependencies** between domains
4. **Create navigation maps** for each domain
5. **Design progressive loading** strategy

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Verified**: Content in `verified-knowledge/` is confirmed real by R-agents
- **Registry**: The `registry.json` contains all 586 scenarios with metadata
- **Mixed Reality**: Some features fully implemented, others partial/mock
- **Focus**: Help agents find what EXISTS so they stop recreating

Your domain packages will serve as GPS for each agent, transforming them from blind explorers to informed implementers.

# UI-OPUS Honest Scenario Documentation Plan

## Objective
Create a truthful CSV documentation of all UI scenarios implemented by UI-OPUS, focusing on reality over inflated claims. This will enable accurate tracking and session continuity.

## Plan Structure

### 1. Create UI_SCENARIOS.csv
Document every UI component I've built with honest status tracking:
- **BDD_File**: Which feature file the scenario comes from
- **Scenario_Number**: Sequential number within that file
- **Scenario_Name**: Brief descriptive name
- **Status**: Implemented/Partial/Not_Implemented/Mock_Only
- **Your_Component**: Actual UI component file (if exists)
- **Test_Type**: Behave/Unit/Mock/None
- **Test_File**: Actual test file path (if exists)

### 2. Create UI_IMPLEMENTATION_TRUTH.md
A detailed breakdown documenting:
- What I actually built vs what I claimed
- Which components use mock data
- Which components have no backend integration
- Real test coverage (not inflated numbers)

### 3. Create UI_SESSION_CONTINUITY.md
Documentation for future sessions:
- Key files to read for context
- Current implementation status
- Critical gaps and priorities
- Integration points with other agents

### 4. Analyze My Real Implementation
Review all my components to categorize honestly:
- **Fully Working**: Complete UI + API + Tests
- **UI Only**: Pretty interface, no real functionality
- **Mock Dependent**: Works with fake data only
- **Claimed but Missing**: Said I built it but didn't

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Honest Component Inventory
1. List all components in `/src/ui/src/modules/`
2. Map each to BDD scenarios
3. Identify mock dependencies
4. Check for real tests

### Phase 2: Create CSV Documentation
Format:
```csv
BDD_File,Scenario_Number,Scenario_Name,Status,Your_Component,Test_Type,Test_File
14-mobile-personal-cabinet,1,Mobile Authentication,Partial,MobilePersonalCabinet.tsx,Mock,None
14-mobile-personal-cabinet,2,Calendar View,Implemented,MobileCalendar.tsx,Mock,None
02-employee-requests,1,Create Request,Partial,RequestManager.tsx,None,None
```

### Phase 3: Truth Documentation
Document honestly:
- Mock data usage in components
- Missing API integrations
- Fake test coverage claims
- Components that don't actually work

### Phase 4: Session Continuity
Create clear documentation for next session:
- Priority files to read
- Current real status
- Integration dependencies
- Next steps for real implementation

## Expected Honest Findings

Based on my analysis, I expect to document:
- **~70 UI components built** (many are just shells)
- **~80% use mock data** or have no backend
- **~5% have real tests** (most claimed tests don't exist)
- **~20% actually work end-to-end** with real data

## Benefits of Honest Reporting

1. **Clear reality baseline** - Know what actually works
2. **Accurate planning** - Real effort estimates
3. **Better integration** - Other agents know what to expect
4. **Focused improvements** - Work on real gaps, not pretend features

## Current Module Analysis (13 modules found):
- business-process-workflows
- demo-plus-estimates
- employee-management
- employee-portal
- forecasting-analytics
- mobile-personal-cabinet
- planning-workflows
- real-time-monitoring
- reports-analytics
- schedule-grid-system
- system-administration
- vacancy-planning
- wfm-integration

## BDD Files to Map (38 files found):
01-system-architecture through 32-mass-assignment-operations

This honest documentation will provide a truthful foundation for future development and integration work.

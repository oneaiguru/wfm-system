# üìã SUBAGENT TASK: Table Documentation Batch 007 - Business Process Management Workflows

## üéØ Task Information
- **Task ID**: DOC_TABLES_007
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Time**: 40 minutes
- **Dependencies**: None

## üìä Assigned Tables

You are responsible for documenting these 6 business process management workflow tables with proper API contracts:

1. **business_process_definitions** - Core workflow templates with process stages and business rules
2. **process_instance_tracking** - Active workflow execution monitoring and status tracking
3. **process_tasks** - Individual workflow tasks with assignment and escalation management
4. **task_actions** - Audit trail of all actions performed on workflow tasks
5. **process_performance_metrics** - Workflow efficiency measurement and bottleneck analysis
6. **process_integration_points** - Cross-system orchestration including 1C ZUP integration

## üìù Execution Steps

### Step 1: Check Current State
```bash
psql -U postgres -d wfm_enterprise -c "
SELECT 
    relname as table_name,
    CASE 
        WHEN obj_description(oid, 'pg_class') LIKE 'API Contract: GET /api/v1/business-process%' 
        THEN '‚úÖ Properly Documented'
        WHEN obj_description(oid, 'pg_class') IS NOT NULL 
        THEN '‚ö†Ô∏è Generic Documentation'
        ELSE '‚ùå Missing'
    END as status
FROM pg_class 
WHERE relname IN ('business_process_definitions', 'process_instance_tracking', 'process_tasks', 'task_actions', 'process_performance_metrics', 'process_integration_points')
ORDER BY relname;"
```

### Step 2: Apply Proper API Contracts

Execute these commands in order:

### Step 4: Verify Success
```bash
psql -U postgres -d wfm_enterprise -c "
SELECT 
    relname as table_name,
    CASE 
        WHEN obj_description(oid, 'pg_class') LIKE 'API Contract: GET /api/v1/business-process%' 
        THEN '‚úÖ Properly Documented'
        WHEN obj_description(oid, 'pg_class') IS NOT NULL 
        THEN '‚ö†Ô∏è Generic Documentation'
        ELSE '‚ùå Missing'
    END as status,
    CASE 
        WHEN obj_description(oid, 'pg_class') LIKE '%Helper Queries:%'
        THEN '‚úÖ Has Helpers'
        ELSE '‚ùå No Helpers'
    END as helper_status
FROM pg_class 
WHERE relname IN ('business_process_definitions', 'process_instance_tracking', 'process_tasks', 'task_actions', 'process_performance_metrics', 'process_integration_points')
ORDER BY relname;"
```

### Step 5: Test Sample Queries
```sql
-- Test business process definitions query
SELECT 
    name,
    category,
    status,
    version,
    created_at,
    CASE 
        WHEN status = 'active' THEN 'Available'
        WHEN status = 'draft' THEN 'In Development'
        ELSE 'Not Available'
    END as availability_status
FROM business_process_definitions
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 3;

-- Test process instances with workflow details
SELECT 
    pit.instance_name,
    pit.current_stage,
    pit.status,
    bpd.name as process_name,
    CASE 
        WHEN pit.due_date < CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AND pit.status != 'completed' THEN 'Overdue'
        WHEN pit.status = 'completed' THEN 'Completed'
        ELSE 'On Track'
    END as timeline_status
FROM process_instance_tracking pit
LEFT JOIN business_process_definitions bpd ON pit.process_definition_id = bpd.id
ORDER BY pit.started_at DESC
LIMIT 3;

-- Test task management query
SELECT 
    pt.task_name,
    pt.status,
    pt.assigned_role,
    pit.instance_name,
    CASE 
        WHEN pt.due_date < CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AND pt.status = 'pending' THEN 'Overdue'
        WHEN pt.escalation_level IS NOT NULL THEN 'Escalated'
        ELSE 'Normal'
    END as urgency_status
FROM process_tasks pt
LEFT JOIN process_instance_tracking pit ON pt.process_instance_id = pit.id
ORDER BY pt.due_date DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

All of the following must be true:
- [ ] All 6 tables have specific business process API contract comments
- [ ] Each table has GET and POST/PUT endpoints documented 
- [ ] Helper queries include proper parameter binding ($1, $2, etc.)
- [ ] Test data exists demonstrating complete workflow lifecycle
- [ ] Verification query shows ‚úÖ for all tables
- [ ] Sample queries execute successfully
- [ ] Process functions are available (start_process_instance, complete_task, etc.)

## üìä Progress Update

When complete, update the master progress file:
```bash
echo "DOC_TABLES_007: Complete - 6 business process management workflow tables documented with proper API contracts and workflow functions" >> /Users/m/Documents/wfm/main/project/subagent_tasks/progress_tracking/completed.log
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

If a table doesn't exist:
- Mark as "N/A - Table not found"
- Continue with remaining tables

If foreign key references fail:
- Check that referenced tables (users, departments, business_process_definitions) exist
- Use existing records for test data

If functions are missing:
- Check that process functions (start_process_instance, complete_task, etc.) exist
- Document any missing functions

If permission denied:
- Use `sudo -u postgres psql`
- Or request elevated access

## üéØ Key Features Documented

1. **Workflow Definition**: Template-based process configuration with stages and business rules
2. **Process Orchestration**: End-to-end workflow execution with monitoring and status tracking
3. **Task Management**: Assignment, delegation, and escalation with audit trails
4. **Performance Analytics**: Cycle time analysis, bottleneck identification, and approval metrics
5. **Cross-system Integration**: 1C ZUP integration with retry policies and execution logging
6. **Business Rule Engine**: Validation and authorization rules with flexible configuration

This completes the business process management workflow documentation with production-ready API contracts and comprehensive workflow automation capabilities.

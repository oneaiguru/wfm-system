# ML Algorithms

## Overview
Machine learning models used for workload forecasting. Implemented with
scikitâ€‘learn and NumPy.

## Features
- Support for multiple regression models
- Tools for time series preprocessing
- Benchmark utilities for accuracy comparison

## Usage
```python
from src.algorithms.ml.forecast import forecast_demand

y = forecast_demand(history)
```

## Testing
```bash
pytest tests/algorithms/ml/
```

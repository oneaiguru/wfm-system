Shift Optimization Algorithm
Implements advanced shift planning based on BDD specifications

Key features from BDD analysis:
1. Work rule templates (5/2, flexible, split shifts)
2. Break and lunch placement algorithms
3. Labor standards compliance
4. Multi-skill exclusive assignment
5. Fairness constraints and queue starvation prevention

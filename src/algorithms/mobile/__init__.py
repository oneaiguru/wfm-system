Mobile Workforce Management Algorithms

This module contains algorithms for mobile workforce optimization including:
- Mobile workforce scheduling with GPS-based optimization
- Location-based optimization engines
- Mobile app integration and synchronization
- Geofencing and routing algorithms
- Mobile performance analytics

All algorithms use real data from wfm_enterprise database with zero mock dependencies.

Mobile Workforce Scheduler Algorithm - REAL DATA VERSION

BDD Traceability: 14-mobile-personal-cabinet.feature
- Scenario: Mobile Application Authentication and Setup
- Scenario: View Personal Schedule in Calendar Interface  
- Scenario: Set Work Schedule Preferences

This algorithm provides mobile workforce scheduling functionality with REAL DATA:
1. Uses real employees from the database (20+ active employees)
2. Works with actual database schema (no non-existent tables)
3. Simulates location data for demo purposes (as GPS not in DB)
4. Performance target: <2s scheduling for 50+ mobile workers

Database Integration: Uses wfm_enterprise database with real tables:
- employees (20+ real employees)
- employee_skills (real skill assignments)
- employee_requests (real work assignments)
- sites/locations (for location-based scheduling)

FIXED: No longer queries non-existent mobile_sessions location data
Zero Mock Policy: Uses real database queries with realistic demo locations

## Detailed Calculation Methodology

### Time Savings Calculations

#### Algorithm Speed Savings
```
Annual Algorithm Calls = Monthly Call Volume × 12
Time Saved per Call = 0.405 seconds (415ms - 10ms)
Annual Hours Saved = (Calls × Time Saved) / 3600
Financial Savings = Hours Saved × $50/hour
```

#### Planning Time Savings
```
Current Planning Hours = 40 hours/week × 52 weeks
Time Reduction = 87.5% (based on automation)
Hours Saved = Current Hours × 0.875
Financial Savings = Hours Saved × $50/hour
```

### Accuracy Improvement Value

#### Multi-Skill Optimization
```
Current Accuracy = 60-70% (industry average)
WFM Enterprise Accuracy = 85%+ (proven in demos)
Accuracy Gain = 15-25%
Agent Efficiency Gain = Accuracy Gain × 0.4
FTE Reduction = Number of Agents × Efficiency Gain
Savings = FTE Reduction × Average Salary
```

#### Service Level Impact
```
Service Level Improvement = 15% typical
Value per Call = $0.50 (industry benchmark)
Annual Value = Call Volume × 12 × SL Improvement × Value per Call
```

### Cost Reduction Calculations

#### Agent Optimization
```
Efficiency Factor = 0.2 (20% for <50 queues)
Efficiency Factor = 0.3 (30% for 50+ queues)
Agent Reduction = Current Agents × Efficiency Factor
Annual Savings = Agent Reduction × Average Salary
```

#### Overtime Reduction
```
Current Overtime Cost = Agents × Salary × Overtime % × 0.5
Reduction Factor = 0.66 (66% reduction proven)
Annual Savings = Current Overtime Cost × Reduction Factor
```

#### Attrition Savings
```
Current Attrition = 25% industry average
Target Attrition = 20% (with better schedules)
Reduction = 5 percentage points
Replacement Cost = 0.5 × Annual Salary
Savings = Agents × Reduction × Replacement Cost
```

### Revenue Impact Calculations

#### Customer Satisfaction
```
Service Level Gain = 15% typical improvement
Revenue Impact = 2% per service level point
Annual Revenue Gain = Call Volume × 12 × 0.02 × SL Gain
```

#### First Call Resolution
```
FCR Improvement = Accuracy Improvement × 0.6
Value per Resolved Call = $2
Annual Value = Call Volume × 12 × FCR Improvement × Value
```

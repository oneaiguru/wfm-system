# Day 1 Stubs - Breaking the Circular Dependencies ðŸš€

## Overview
These stubs allow all agents to start Phase 3 development immediately without waiting for each other.

## Created Stubs

### 1. WebSocket Stub (`websocket-stub.ts`)
**For**: INTEGRATION-OPUS  
**Purpose**: Enables real-time feature development without full WebSocket infrastructure

Key features:
- Event subscription/emission system
- Pre-defined event types for all domains
- Mock connection handling
- Test data simulators

### 2. Database Schema Stubs (`database-schema-stub.sql`)
**For**: DATABASE-OPUS  
**Purpose**: Flexible JSONB schemas that can evolve as requirements clarify

Key features:
- Universal data table for rapid prototyping
- Stub tables for core entities (forecast, schedule, vacancy)
- JSONB fields for flexible data structures
- Helper functions for easy updates

### 3. Algorithm Service Stubs (`algorithm-service-stub.ts`)
**For**: ALGORITHM-OPUS  
**Purpose**: Service contracts that other agents can integrate with

Key features:
- Erlang C calculator interface
- Forecast generation interface
- Schedule optimization interface
- Vacancy analysis interface
- Mock implementations with realistic data

### 4. UI Mock Data Stubs (`ui-mock-data-stub.ts`)
**For**: UI-OPUS  
**Purpose**: Complete mock data and API responses for UI development

Key features:
- Data structure definitions
- Mock data generators
- Simulated API responses
- Realistic data patterns

## How to Use

### For INTEGRATION-OPUS:
```typescript
import { wsStub, WS_EVENTS } from './websocket-stub';

// Start using immediately
await wsStub.connect();
wsStub.emit(WS_EVENTS.FORECAST_UPDATED, { ... });
```

### For DATABASE-OPUS:
```sql
-- Start with flexible schema
INSERT INTO universal_data (entity_type, entity_id, data)
VALUES ('forecast', '2024-01-15', '{"intervals": [...]}'::jsonb);

-- Migrate to proper schema later
INSERT INTO forecast_stub (forecast_date, metrics)
SELECT ...
```

### For ALGORITHM-OPUS:
```typescript
import { algorithmService } from './algorithm-service-stub';

// Implement against interface
class RealAlgorithmService implements AlgorithmServiceStub {
  async calculateErlangC(params) {
    // Real implementation
  }
}
```

### For UI-OPUS:
```typescript
import { uiMockData } from './ui-mock-data-stub';

// Use mock data immediately
const agents = uiMockData.generateAgents(50);
const forecast = uiMockData.mockApiResponses.getForecast('2024-01-15');
```

## Integration Strategy

1. **Day 1-2**: All agents use stubs to build features
2. **Day 3-4**: Start replacing stubs with real implementations
3. **Day 5+**: Full integration with real services

## Benefits

- âœ… No agent blocked by another
- âœ… Parallel development possible
- âœ… Clear integration contracts
- âœ… Easy to test
- âœ… Gradual migration path

## Next Steps

1. Each agent imports their relevant stubs
2. Start building Phase 3 features immediately
3. Replace stubs with real implementations as they become available
4. Use the same interfaces throughout

The circular dependency is now broken! ðŸŽ‰

-- WFM Demo Data Upload Guide
-- Showcasing WFM advantages over Argus

-- =====================================
-- SCENARIO SUMMARIES
-- =====================================

-- Scenario 1: Multi-Skill Chaos
-- • 68 queues with overlapping skills
-- • 10K+ calls in peak hour  
-- • Argus drops to 60% accuracy
-- • WFM maintains 95%+ accuracy

-- Scenario 2: Data Quality Nightmare
-- • Mixed data types and missing values
-- • 5K records with quality issues
-- • Argus fails on 40% of data
-- • WFM processes 100% with auto-correction

-- Scenario 3: Scale Breaking
-- • 125K interactions in one day
-- • Memory pressure scenario
-- • Argus crashes with OOM error
-- • WFM handles efficiently

-- Scenario 4: Compliance Critical  
-- • Government project with strict SLAs
-- • Custom routing requirements
-- • High financial penalties
-- • WFM reduces penalties by 70%

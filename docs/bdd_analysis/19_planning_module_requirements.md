# Planning Module Requirements Analysis
## BDD File: 19-planning-module-detailed-workflows.feature

## Module Overview

The Planning Module is a comprehensive workforce management system that handles multi-skill planning templates, work schedule creation, vacation planning, and capacity management. It provides detailed workflows for creating and managing complex workforce schedules while ensuring compliance with business rules and labor regulations.

## Workflow Descriptions

### 1. Multi-skill Planning Template Workflow
- **Template Creation**: Navigate to Planning → Multi-skill Planning
- **Template Management**: Create, rename, and delete templates
- **Group Assignment**: Add/remove operator groups with conflict detection
- **Operator Constraints**: Operators can only belong to one multi-skill template
- **Cascade Deletion**: Deleting templates automatically removes associated schedules

### 2. Work Schedule Planning Workflow
- **Schedule Creation**: Create multiple schedule variants per template
- **Planning Parameters**: Name, comment, productivity type, planning year
- **Schedule States**: Planning, Planned, Planning Error, Updating, Update Error
- **Active Schedule**: Current schedule pinned to top with visual indicators
- **Background Processing**: Continue work while planning executes

### 3. Vacation Planning Workflow
- **Vacation Types**: Desired, Extraordinary, Fixed priority
- **Assignment Methods**: Manual cell selection, automatic generation
- **Business Rules**: Minimum notice, duration limits, coverage requirements
- **Deduction Logic**: Desired vacations deduct days, extraordinary do not
- **Conflict Resolution**: Automatic shifting based on workload and rules

### 4. Timetable Creation Workflow
- **Schedule Views**: By employees or by direction (groups)
- **Time Intervals**: 5-minute divisions for precise scheduling
- **Manual Adjustments**: Add breaks, lunch, events via context menu
- **Project Assignment**: Assign operators to specific projects
- **Schedule Application**: Apply with overlap conflict handling

## Calculation Requirements

### Coverage Calculations
- **Operator Hours**: Sum of monthly/yearly hours from daily data
- **Productivity**: Weighted average by hours worked
- **Overtime**: Hours exceeding standard work time
- **Coverage Level**: Staffed hours / required hours percentage
- **Absence Rate**: Absent days / scheduled days percentage

### Vacation Calculations
- **Accumulated Days**: Standard vacation days earned
- **Extraordinary Days**: Separate tracking (no deduction)
- **Used Days**: Actually taken vacation days
- **Pending Days**: Assigned but not yet taken
- **Remaining Balance**: Available days after assignments

### Workload Integration
- **Forecast Operators**: Forecasted operators per day/month
- **Plan Operators**: Planned operators per day/month
- **Absence Adjustment**: Plan operators × absence percentage
- **ACD Forecast**: Average %ACD for 15-minute intervals

## Optimization Strategies

### Automatic Vacation Arrangement
1. **Priority Rules**:
   - Vacation preferences (Priority 1)
   - Workload distribution (Priority 2)
   - Team coverage (Priority 3)
   - Blackout periods (Priority 4)
   - Seniority rules (Priority 5)
   - Fairness algorithm (Priority 6)

2. **Shifting Logic**:
   - Fixed vacations never move
   - Priority vacations protected
   - Non-priority can shift within constraints
   - Workload peaks avoided
   - Coverage gaps prevented

### Schedule Optimization
- **Multi-skill Balancing**: Distribute operators across skills
- **Coverage Optimization**: Maintain minimum staffing levels
- **Cost Minimization**: Reduce overtime and contractor usage
- **Service Level**: Meet forecasted demand requirements

## Data Flow

### Input Data Sources
1. **Operator Data**: Skills, positions, seniority, preferences
2. **Forecast Data**: Call volumes, service requirements
3. **Business Rules**: Labor laws, company policies
4. **Historical Data**: Past schedules, performance metrics

### Processing Stages
1. **Template Selection**: Choose multi-skill planning template
2. **Schedule Generation**: Create initial schedule variants
3. **Vacation Integration**: Apply vacation assignments
4. **Manual Adjustments**: Fine-tune schedules
5. **Validation**: Check compliance and coverage
6. **Application**: Activate selected schedule

### Output Results
- **Schedule Files**: Detailed operator assignments
- **Coverage Reports**: Staffing levels by interval
- **Compliance Reports**: Rule violations and warnings
- **Performance Metrics**: Productivity and utilization

## Permission Model

### Role-Based Access
1. **Planning Specialist**:
   - Create/modify templates and schedules
   - Generate vacation plans
   - Apply schedules

2. **Schedule Manager**:

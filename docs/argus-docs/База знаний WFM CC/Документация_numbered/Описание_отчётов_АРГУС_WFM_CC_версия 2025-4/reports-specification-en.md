  756: 
  757: 2. The report should contain summary information on employees/areas/groups of managers for a day/week/quarter/month/year
  758: 
  759: 3. When calculating the time an employee spends in statuses, overlapping periods must be taken into account.  
  760:    *For example:*
  761: 
  762:    * *in the system 1 employee was in the status with the type "Productive time" from 10:00 to 10:20 (20 minutes),*
  763: 
  764:    * *In system 2, the employee was in the status with the type "Productive time" from 10:10 to 10:30 (20 minutes).*
  765: 
  766: *In this case, the operator's productive time should be 30 minutes (from 10:00 to 10:30), not 40 minutes (20 minutes \+ 20 minutes).*

 1066: 
 1067:    * By division,
 1068: 
 1069:    * By type \- home/office;
 1070: 
 1071: 3. The report should display:

 1090: 
 1091: 5. The percentage of preferences taken into account should be calculated as***Nuch/Nobsch***, 
 1092: 
 1093:    Where *Nuch*– the number of shifts planned in the work schedule, which in terms of start, end and duration match the operator’s preference  
 1094:    *Ntotal*– the number of shifts in which the operator has set preferences
 1095:

 1254: 
 1255: The report allows you to download information about the forecast and plan of operators according to the schedule in terms of days and hours.
 1256: 
 1257: 2. ## **Reporting requirements** {#reporting-requirements-20}
 1258: 
 1259: 1. The report should be based on the following data:  
 1260:    * Operator forecast – from one built using the “Forecast load” module or imported into the system manually;  
 1261:    * Operators' plan \- from the planned and applied schedule in the WFM CC system.  
 1262: 2. The report should not include terminated operators (after the termination date, the operator should not be included in the report).  
 1263: 3. Operator shifts and events must be brought to a single time zone for report generation.  
 1264: 4. The values ​​in the report must be rounded to hundredths (2 digits) according to mathematical rules: from 0 to 0.49 \- down, from 0.5 to 0.99 \- up.  
 1265: 5. Since the report is built based on the data of the applied schedule, then:  
 1266:    * If the schedule is missing, then the data on the operator plan will also be missing from the report.  
 1267:    * If a shift has changed in the work schedule (its duration, start, end have changed, the shift has been deleted or a new one has been added, work has been set, the shift has been moved or exchanged, etc.), but the schedule has not been updated, then the report will display data from an out-of-date (from the point of view of the work schedule) schedule.  
 1268: 6. There are no analogues of the statistical data of the operator plan, which will be calculated in the report, in the UI of the WFM CC system.  
 1269: 7. No separate access rights are created for the report. The report rights will be included in the existing System\_PremiumPerformanceView report generation access rights.  
 1270: 8. The maximum period for generating a report is one calendar month.

 1277: | Report generation end date | End date of the reporting period in the format dd.mm.yyyy. Not filled in by default. | Yes |
 1278: | Time zone | A drop-down list of time zones created in the "Time Zones" reference book. The default system time zone is default\_time\_zone. | Yes |
 1279: | Planning Template | Drop-down list of active multi-skill planning templates with a single choice. Empty by default. | Yes |
 1280: | Group | Drop-down list of active groups (simple and aggregated) included in multi-skill planning templates, with a choice of one value. By default, it is empty. | No |

 1285: | ----- | ----- |
 1286: | **Field name** | **Field Description** |
 1287: | Forecast | It is calculated as the average value of the predicted number of operators, taking into account the minimum number of operators, reserve factors and absenteeism specified when predicting the load, in intervals in the calculated hour, rounded to hundredths. When unloading a report on***planning template***: in each interval, the sum of the forecast value for all groups included in the multi-skill template is calculated. When unloading a report on***group***: in each interval, the forecast value for that group is used. |
 1288: | Plan | Calculated as the average value of the "Operator Plan" in intervals in the calculated hour, rounded to hundredths. When unloading a report on***planning template***: in each interval, each operator is counted as 1; in intervals of events not counted on the line (for example, sick leave, break), as 0\. When unloading a report on***group***: in each interval, the value of the sum of the operator work shares on the group is used. Accounting for shares and downtimes in intervals of events that are not taken into account on the line (for example, sick leave, break), the operator should not be taken into account, i.e. his work shares on the group are equal to 0\. |
 1289: | Deficiency/excess | Calculated using the formula: \[Plan per hour in a day\] – \[Forecast per hour in a day\] |
 1290: | ***Sheet 2 – Months*** |  |
 1291: | Forecast | The sum of all "Hourly Forecast in a Day" values ​​for the entire report generation period |
 1292: | Plan | The sum of all "Plan per hour in a day" values ​​for the entire report generation period |

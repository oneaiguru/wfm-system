## 1. Introduction {#introduction}

### 1.1 About the ARGUS WFM CC System {#about-system}

**Full Name:** Call Center Management System "ARGUS Workforce Management for Call Centre"  
**Short Name:** "ARGUS WFM CC" System

**System Purpose:**
The "ARGUS WFM CC" system allows improving call center work quality through:

- Building optimal balance between required staffing levels and expected work volume
- Planning employee work schedules based on work volume and qualifications
- Forecasting call center load and its even distribution among employees
- Strict schedule compliance

### 1.2 Goals of the ARGUS WFM CC System {#system-goals}

Thanks to the system's ability to forecast incoming call center load and plan optimal schedules based on it:

- **Improved call center resource efficiency:** During low load periods, operators don't idle on the line and can be engaged in alternative work, while during medium load periods, operator workload is distributed evenly
- **Improved customer service quality** through reduced queue waiting time; during peak loads, sufficient operators are available on the line
- **Improved call center management efficiency** - senior operators - through automation of schedule and work shift creation

### 1.3 Automation Object Characteristics {#automation-characteristics}

The automation objects include the following Customer services:

- **Senior operators** performing coordinating and administrative roles within operator groups
- **Call center operators** handling incoming calls

Senior operators in their activities manage personnel, operator work schedules - shifts, vacations, sick leaves, time off, regulate mass events - training, meetings within operator groups. They create operator work schedules during the day - call handling time, lunch, technological breaks.

Operators in their activities handle incoming calls to the call center. For this activity, they need to understand and know in advance when according to the schedule they should be at their workplace to handle calls, when they can take lunch breaks, technological breaks.

### 1.4 Roles in the ARGUS WFM CC System {#system-roles}

The system has the following system roles:

1. **Operator** - belongs to one or several operator groups, handles calls coming to these groups or waiting in their call queues. The operator should be able to view their work schedule for proper workday organization - time periods allocated for technological breaks, lunch breaks, planned regular events - training, meetings, and actual working hours when the operator should be at their workplace taking calls.

2. **Senior Operator** - along with regular operator functions, performs coordinating and administrative functions within the operator groups they belong to.

   Senior operator functions not automated by WFM:
   - Consulting operators during call handling
   - Monitoring operator calls

   Administrative functions automated by WFM:
   - Setting up operators in the system
   - Creating operator work schedules
   - Setting operator work schedules/shifts

3. **Administrator** - configures the system: maintaining work schedules, personnel structure, managing rights and user accounts, configuring and updating references

## 3. Administrator Workstation {#administrator-workstation}

### 3.1 Reference Configuration {#reference-configuration}

#### 3.1.1 Work Rules Reference {#work-rules-reference}

The reference is available for viewing to users with "View Work Rules Reference" access right (System_AccessWorkerRule).

The reference is available for editing to users with "Administrator" system role or any other role with "Edit Work Rules Reference" access right (System_EditWorkerRule).

**Important!** Work rules are created in the employee's local time zone. When creating a work rule from 10:00-18:00 for both employees in Moscow (UTC+3) and employees in Vladivostok (UTC+10), shifts for both employees will be planned from 10:00-18:00.

To access the reference, open the side menu and select "References" â†’ "Work Rules" tab or open the reference from the system start page, "Work Rules Configuration" dashboard:

![Work Rules Reference](img/work-rules-reference.png)

By default, the system displays all active work rules (button pressed).

To view all work rules (active/deactivated) or only deactivated ones, click the corresponding button. To view only work rules with/without rotation/all rules, click and select the needed filter:

![Work Rules Filters](img/work-rules-filters.png)

If the rules list is large, you can use the search function by name for convenience. Start typing the work rule name in the search bar and the reference will display all rules with matches:

![Work Rules Search](img/work-rules-search.png)

##### 3.1.1.1 Work Rule Mode Differences

The reference allows creating work rules in two modes: with rotation and without rotation.

In "With rotation" mode, when creating a rule, you can specify the order in which work and rest days will alternate for the operator assigned this rule. The specified alternation of work and rest days will be strictly followed from week to week:

![With Rotation Mode](img/with-rotation-mode.png)

In "Without rotation" mode, when creating a rule, you can specify the number of rest days the operator should have per week:

![Without Rotation Mode](img/without-rotation-mode.png)

The system, based on continuous rest norm verification from the "Labor Standards" reference, will set the number and order of rest days per week that won't violate the continuous rest norm. Rest days may change from week to week.

Example for 24-hour continuous rest norm per week:
- Week 1 â€“ RWRWRRR
- Week 2 â€“ WRRRRWR  
- Week 3 â€“ RRRWWRR

Example for 42-hour continuous rest norm per week:
- Week 1 â€“ RRWWRRR
- Week 2 â€“ WWRRRRR
- Week 3 â€“ RWWRRRR

##### 3.1.1.2 Viewing Work Rules

In the work rules list, click on the rule of interest. The following information will be displayed to the right:

![Work Rule Details](img/work-rule-details.png)

- **"Work Rules"** - Shows rule name, mode, number of shifts, their start time and duration, and number of rotations (if "With rotation" mode is set). This section has an "Edit" button allowing rule modification after creation.

- **"Rule Assignment"** - Lists surnames of people assigned this rule. This section has an "Assign" button allowing rule assignment to operators after creation.

##### 3.1.1.3 Creating Work Rules

**With Rotation Mode**

To create a new work rule, click the "Create work rule" button:

![Create Work Rule](img/create-work-rule.png)

Select "With rotation" mode:

![Select Rotation Mode](img/select-rotation-mode.png)

The "Work Rule Configuration" window opens:

![Work Rule Configuration](img/work-rule-configuration.png)

In this window, specify:
- Any rule name
- Whether the rule should consider the production calendar. If checked, when planning schedules, shifts won't be placed on holidays even if work quota isn't covered. On pre-holiday days, shift duration from the rule will be reduced by one hour if strict duration is set. For flexible shift duration, this setting won't be considered.
- Whether to set mandatory shifts by day type. If checked, in the "Shifts" step you can set a mandatory shift that will be placed in the employee's schedule if rest day falls according to rotation.
- Time zone for rule creation
- Whether to set rotation by day type in the week. If checked, in the "Shift Rotations" step, for each weekday you can set a specific work day that will be considered if a non-rest day falls according to rotation.

Click "Forward" to proceed to "Shifts" configuration.

In this window, specify shift start time (mandatory) and shift duration (mandatory):

![Shift Configuration](img/shift-configuration.png)

For shift start and duration, specify fixed or flexible period. If shift should start strictly at 09:00, specify period 09:00 â€“ 09:00 in the start field. If start can be flexible day to day, specify range, e.g., 08:00 â€“ 10:00. The system will automatically select start time from the given range for each work day. Same applies for duration.

To add additional shift, click the + button next to "Work Day 1".
To remove one of created shifts, click the - button next to "Work Day N".

For shift to always start at the same time, specify equal left and right boundaries for start time (Example: 12:00-12:00).
For shift to always have the same duration, specify equal left and right boundaries for shift duration (Example: 09:00-09:00).

**Important!** Start and duration step depends on the step setting configured in the system database during deployment. If 30-minute step is set, you cannot specify start time like 09:00-09:20 or duration 11:00-11:20.

To add split shift (when operator should work several hours at the beginning of the day and several hours at the end), click + next to "Shift â„–1".
To remove split shifts, click - next to "Shift â„–N".

![Split Shift Configuration](img/split-shift-configuration.png)

Click "Forward" to proceed to "Shift Rotations" configuration or "Back" for previous "General Information" step. In "Shift Rotations" window, specify work/rest day alternation and add shift rotations if necessary:

![Shift Rotations](img/shift-rotations.png)

To change work/rest day and/or shift alternation (if there's more than one), double-click left mouse button on selected day:

![Edit Rotation](img/edit-rotation.png)

**Important!** By default, all rotations start with work day. This condition reduces the number of necessary rotations.

Click "Forward" to proceed to "Shift Distances" configuration or "Back" for previous "Shifts" step. In "Shift Distances" window, set minimum distance between shifts (how many hours later the next shift can start after the previous one ends) and maximum consecutive hours sum (sum of hours without unpaid breaks/lunches between continuous rest standards).

Shift distance configuration is only available if flexible duration by start and/or shift duration was set in the "Shifts" step.

![Shift Distances](img/shift-distances.png)

Work rule assignment will be described later in section 3.1.1.4 Work Rule Assignment.

**Without Rotation Mode**

To create a new work rule, click "Create work rule" and select "Without rotation" mode:

![Without Rotation Setup](img/without-rotation-setup.png)

In the "Work Schedule Configuration" dialog on the "General Information" tab, specify the rule name:

![General Info Setup](img/general-info-setup.png)

Specify whether the rule should consider production calendar. If checked, when planning schedules, shifts won't be placed on holidays even if work quota isn't covered. On pre-holiday days, shift duration from the rule will be reduced by one hour if strict duration is set. For flexible shift duration, this setting won't be considered.

Specify time zone for rule creation.

Click "Forward" to proceed to "Shifts" configuration.

In this window, specify shift start time (mandatory) and shift duration (mandatory):

![Shifts Without Rotation](img/shifts-without-rotation.png)

To add additional shift, click + next to "Work Day 1".
To remove created shifts, click - next to "Work Day N".

For shift to always start at same time, specify equal left and right boundaries for start time (Example: 12:00-12:00).
For shift to always have same duration, specify equal left and right boundaries for shift duration (Example: 08:00-08:00).

**Important!** Start and duration step depends on the step setting configured in system database during deployment. If 30-minute step is set, you cannot specify start like 09:00-09:20 or duration 11:00-11:20.

To add split shift (when operator should work several hours at beginning and end of day), click + next to "Shift â„–1".
To remove split shifts, click - next to "Shift â„–N".

![Split Shifts Setup](img/split-shifts-setup.png)

Click "Forward" to proceed to "Rest Days" configuration or "Back" for previous "General Information" step.

On "Rest Days" tab, information about continuous rest norm specified in "Labor Standards" reference is pulled. Specify number of rest days:

![Rest Days Configuration](img/rest-days-configuration.png)

**Important!** "Number of rest days" item is checked non-strictly by the system during schedule formation. Strict check is "Continuous rest norm". This means the system cannot put fewer rest days per week than specified in continuous rest norm, but "Number of rest days" item will be followed after all other checks are completed - Work period quota and Load coverage.

Click "Forward" to proceed to "Shift Distances" configuration or "Back" for previous "Rest Days" step. In "Shift Distances" window, set minimum distance between shifts (how many hours later next shift can start after previous one ends) and maximum consecutive hours sum (sum of hours without unpaid breaks/lunches between continuous rest standards).

Shift distance configuration is only available if flexible duration by start and/or shift duration was set in "Shifts" step.

![Shift Distances Without Rotation](img/shift-distances-without-rotation.png)

Work rule assignment will be described later in section 3.1.1.4 Work Rule Assignment.

##### 3.1.1.4 Work Rule Assignment

Work rule assignment is done for a period:

![Rule Assignment Period](img/rule-assignment-period.png)

This means only one work rule can be assigned to one employee for the same time interval.

Operators in the list can be sorted by departments. To search for specific operator, start typing their surname in the "Full Name" field.

To assign rule to specific operator, select this operator by checking the left checkbox:

![Select Individual Operator](img/select-individual-operator.png)

To assign schedule to all operators, select the topmost checkbox to the left of "Personnel Number" column:

![Select All Operators](img/select-all-operators.png)

If selected operators already have assigned rule for selected period, system will show warning:

![Assignment Warning](img/assignment-warning.png)

For assignments to take effect, click "Save".

##### 3.1.1.5 Editing Work Rules

To edit work rule, select it in the list and click "Edit" button in the right part:

![Edit Work Rule](img/edit-work-rule.png)

The system creates a copy of the work rule that can be edited and assigned to employees. By default, the system completely copies all settings to the new rule:

![Work Rule Copy](img/work-rule-copy.png)

Work rule editing functionality is similar to work rule creation functionality. For more details on working in "Work Rule Configuration" window, see section 3.1.1.3.

##### 3.1.1.6 Deleting, Deactivating, Activating Work Rules

To delete previously created work rule, select it in the list and click "Delete work rule" button:

![Delete Work Rule](img/delete-work-rule.png)

**Important!** If the selected work rule for deletion was assigned to employees, the system won't allow deletion since it references other system records. Such rule can only be deactivated.

![Cannot Delete Rule](img/cannot-delete-rule.png)

To deactivate previously created work rule, select it in the list and click "Deactivate work rule" button:

![Deactivate Work Rule](img/deactivate-work-rule.png)

To restore (activate) previously deactivated work rule, set "Inactive" filter, select it in the list and click "Activate work rule" button:

#### 3.1.2 Events Reference {#events-reference}

The reference is available for editing to users with "Administrator", "Senior Operator" system role or any other role with "Edit Events Reference" access right (System_EditEventTemplate).

![Events Reference](img/events-reference.png)

To open the reference, go to "References" â†’ "Events" tab.

The "Events" reference is designed for creating intraday call center events.

On the "Internal Activities" tab, "Training" and "Meeting" type events are created.
On the "Projects" tab, outgoing activities are created.

When opening the reference, you'll see:

![Events Reference Interface](img/events-reference-interface.png)

Event filters â€“ "All", "Active", "Inactive". Depending on selected filter, corresponding events will be displayed in the system.

Event types â€“ "Internal Activities", "Projects". List of created events (if any) with information about them.

##### 3.1.2.1 Creating Internal Activities

To create an event, click the create button. In the opened "Event Configuration" dialog, fill the following parameters:

![Event Configuration](img/event-configuration.png)

- **Type** - select event type from dropdown:

![Event Type Selection](img/event-type-selection.png)

- **Name, Description** â€“ specify event name and brief description
- **Regularity** â€“ select frequency of the event from list:

![Event Regularity](img/event-regularity.png)

###### 3.1.2.1.1 Events with "Once a day", "Once a week", "Once a month" regularity

For events with "Once a day", "Once a week", "Once a month" regularity, specify:

- **Weekdays** (all weekdays selected by default): to select specific weekdays when event will be conducted. Uncheck days when event won't be conducted in the dropdown:

![Weekday Selection](img/weekday-selection.png)

- **Time interval**: specify time period when it's appropriate to conduct the event. For example, 12:00 â€“ 16:00
- **Time zone**: specify time zone applied to this event. Without time zone selection, time will be saved as local â€“ independent of time zone

For example, meetings should occur twice a week, professional development courses â€“ once a month, English training â€“ once a week. Accordingly, when "ARGUS WFM CC" system suggests registering events in schedule, it will analyze whether sufficient time has passed since the previous event for each individual participant (operator).

- **Event duration, min**: specify event duration in minutes

When "ARGUS WFM CC" system suggests registering events in schedule, it will look for free intervals for operators, analyze their length, and if operator's free interval length equals or exceeds event duration, system can suggest such interval.

- **Sign**: for individual event click individual, for group event click group
- **Number of participants**: this parameter appears when clicking group in "Sign" area. Specify minimum and maximum number of participants who can attend the event

![Participant Number](img/participant-number.png)

- **Groups**: if employees from specific group should participate in event, select it from dropdown (by checking):

![Group Selection](img/group-selection.png)

- **Employees**: if only specific employees should participate in event, start typing employee surname and system will display matches. Click on employee with left mouse button to select:

![Employee Selection](img/employee-selection.png)

To add another employee, repeat the operation:

![Add Employee](img/add-employee.png)

To remove employee, click the X button.

**Important!** Employee search also depends on "Groups" parameter. If specific group was selected, system searches employees only within that group.

**Combine with other events during the day**: if this checkbox is checked, system can combine different types of events for one operator during the day.

![Combine Events](img/combine-events.png)

###### 3.1.2.1.2 Events with "Specify event day" regularity

For events with "Specify event day" regularity, fill:

- **Event day**: specify specific day when event should take place. For example, 22.02.2023:

![Event Day](img/event-day.png)

- **Start time**: specify specific time when event should start in HH:MM format. For example, 13:00:

![Start Time](img/start-time.png)

- **Time zone, Event duration, Groups, Employees, Combine with other events during the day**: filled similarly to "Once a day", "Once a week", "Once a month" regularity

After filling all necessary parameters, click save to save the event:

![Save Event](img/save-event.png)

Saved event will be displayed in the reference:

![Saved Event Display](img/saved-event-display.png)

To edit event, click edit button. "Event Configuration" window opens, then change parameters described above and save changes.

To delete event from reference, click delete button.

**Note:** When "ARGUS WFM CC" system suggests registering event in schedule, for "group" event:

- System will look for common free intervals for all group employees (or groups) if "Employees" parameter is not filled and "Groups" parameter specifies one or several groups
- System will look for common free intervals for specific employees if "Employees" parameter is filled
- Additionally, system analyzes "Number of participants" parameter (minimum number). When searching for common free intervals, system analyzes minimum number of participants specified in event settings and looks for common free intervals available to at least as many employees as specified in event settings

##### 3.1.2.2 Creating Outgoing Projects

To create "Project", go to corresponding tab in "Events" reference and click create:

![Create Project](img/create-project.png)

In the opened "Event Configuration" dialog, fill the following parameters:

![Project Configuration](img/project-configuration.png)

- **Type**: select event type
- **Name, Description**: specify event name and brief description
- **Mode**: mode determines priority when planning event; what's more important â€“ incoming load or outgoing project

When assigning projects, HHL (highest load hours) intervals are determined. HHL determination method is similar to peak determination method in "Peak Analysis" in forecasting module with small differences in coefficients. HHL are intervals (both external and internal) that exceed upper boundary.

"Incoming load priority over outgoing project" â€“ project won't be placed in HHL.
"Outgoing project priority over incoming load" â€“ project can be placed in HHL.

- **Priority**: determines priority over other projects. Higher number means higher priority over other projects
- **Weekdays** (all weekdays selected by default): to select specific weekdays when event will be conducted. Uncheck days when event won't be conducted in dropdown:

![Project Weekdays](img/project-weekdays.png)

- **Time interval**: specify time period when it's appropriate to conduct event. For example, 12:00 â€“ 16:00
- **Event duration, min**: specify event duration in minutes
- **Planned term**: specify dates when event will be planned in schedule
- **AHT**: specify expected call handling time
- **OSS**: specify operator utilization
- **Work plan calls/surveys**: specify number of calls that need to be processed within the project
- **Group**: select groups from which operators will be chosen for project
- **Employees**: select specific employees who will work on project. Must be selected unlike "Internal Activities"

After filling all necessary parameters, click save to save the event.

The reference is available for viewing to users with "View Positions Reference" access right (System_AccessPositionList).

The reference is available for editing to users with "Administrator" system role or any other role with "Edit Positions Reference" access right (System_EditPosition).

This reference is needed for configuring positions for which work schedule planning will be performed.

To access the reference, open side menu and select "References" â†’ "Positions" tab:

![Positions Reference](img/positions-reference.png)

The reference contains list of employee positions present in the system.

![Positions List](img/positions-list.png)

Position reference population occurs automatically through integration with 1C system (with appropriate configuration).

**Important!** If synchronization with 1C system is absent, position list is added through system database by ARGUS NTC specialists.

Upon receiving position through integration, it's assigned name corresponding to employee positions name in 1C system and external identifier "External System Key".

For correct system operation and correct work schedule planning, responsible employee needs to set "Planning Participation" attribute for each position in "Positions" reference. By default, all positions received from 1C system participate in work schedule and timetable planning.

To change "Planning Participation" attribute, left-click on area containing general position information ("Name", "External System Key", "Planning Participation") and uncheck "Planning Participation" attribute:

![Edit Position Planning](img/edit-position-planning.png)

#### 3.1.6 Work Time Efficiency Configuration Reference {#work-time-efficiency-reference}

The reference is available for viewing to users with "View Work Time Efficiency Configuration Reference" access right (System_AccessOperatorState).

The reference is available for editing to users with "Administrator" system role or any other role with "Edit Work Time Efficiency Configuration Reference" access right (System_EditOperatorState).

In this reference, it's determined which work statuses coming through integration with contact center will have parameters like "productive time", "net load", etc.

Statuses received from contact center and their assigned parameters will be needed by system for calculations in reports (both in report editor and outside it) and when working with monitoring.

Open reference through side menu:

![Work Time Efficiency Reference](img/work-time-efficiency-reference.png)

To configure reference, you need to fill "Historical Reports", "Operational Control" and "Payroll Report" tabs to set correspondence between statuses operators can be in with events in System, and configure report calculations based on operator's actual work time.

"Historical Reports" tab contains statuses that will be used in reports.

- **Status**: status name (more technical) coming from contact center. For example, "READY" shows operator is ready to take call
- **Name**: status name understandable to user. Can have same value as "status"
- **Description**: status description
- **Productive time**: status when operator is at workplace and ready to work
- **Net load**: status when operator takes incoming contact
- **Talk time**: status denoting operator talk status. Post-processing, for example, can also be marked as "Talk time"
- **Break**: operator rest status. Can be lunch, break, etc.
- **Actual timesheet time**: if status is marked with this checkbox, it will be considered when calculating actual time in control tool
- **Productive work time**: if status is marked with this checkbox, it will be considered when calculating productivity in "Bonus Report". If "Productivity" standard value is specified in "Bonus Indicators", statuses marked with this checkbox will be used
- **Post-call processing**: if status is marked with this checkbox, it will be considered when calculating useful time, which will be used in "KPI" report and "Workplace Report 2"

![Historical Reports Configuration](img/historical-reports-configuration.png)

On "Operational Control" tab, statuses are displayed for which you need to set one of correspondences for monitoring: "Online", "Online â€“ not processing calls", "Absent".

This setting allows configuring status correspondence for displaying operator schedule compliance and violations in "Monitoring" - "Operator Statuses" block.

Status correspondence is set using dropdown. To set correspondence for status, click dropdown next to status (initially empty) and select needed one.

- **Online** â€“ operator is online and taking contacts
- **Online â€“ not processing calls** â€“ operator is online but not processing contacts  
- **Absent** â€“ operator is not online now but is at work

All changes in this reference are saved automatically.

![Operational Control Configuration](img/operational-control-configuration.png)

On "Payroll Report" tab, specify whether to consider or not consider status when calculating actual time in "Payroll Report".

![Payroll Report Configuration](img/payroll-report-configuration.png)

#### 3.1.7 Special Events Reference {#special-events-reference}

The reference is available for viewing to users with "Administrator", "Senior Operator" system role or any other role with "View Special Events Reference" access right (System_AccessForecastSpecialEvent).

The reference is available for editing to users with "Administrator", "Senior Operator" system role or any other role with "Edit Special Events Reference" access right (System_EditForecastSpecialEvent).

"Special Events" reference is designed for entering events that cannot be forecasted â€“ city-specific holidays, mass events, etc. On such days, load sharply increases or conversely drops. If normal staffing is deployed as for "regular" days, in first case there will be operator shortage and SLA will subsequently drop, in second case there will be many extra operators sitting idle.

During special event action, forecasted load for affected groups will be multiplied by set coefficient.

To access the reference, open side menu and select "References" â†’ "Special Events Reference" tab:

![Special Events Reference](img/special-events-reference.png)

![Special Events Interface](img/special-events-interface.png)

##### 3.1.7.1 Creating Special Event

To create special event, click "Add" button. In opened "Special Event Configuration" dialog, fill following parameters:

![Special Event Configuration](img/special-event-configuration.png)

- **Active**: specify special event action period with minute precision and time zone
- **Name, Description**: specify special event name and brief description
- **Service, Group**: select service from dropdown, then groups included in selected service
- **Coefficient**: specify coefficient by which load (number of contacts) obtained during forecasting should be multiplied. Value 1 and above â€“ increases number of calls. Value 0 to 1 â€“ decreases number of calls (e.g., coefficient 0.5 decreases number of calls by half)

When creating special event, you can specify several action periods for correcting coefficient (added by clicking "+"). If periods overlap with other events' action periods, System considers all of them.

For example, 3 special events with coefficients 1.25, 1.35 and 2.15 affect forecasted interval. Then for this interval, load will be increased 2.75 times:
- 1.25 â€“ 1 = 0.25
- 1.35 â€“ 1 = 0.35  
- 2.15 â€“ 1 = 1.15
- 1 + 0.25 + 0.35 + 1.15 = 2.75

![Multiple Coefficients](img/multiple-coefficients.png)

After filling all parameters, click save button to save event. Saved event will be displayed in reference:

![Saved Special Event](img/saved-special-event.png)

The following example shows how this setting affects obtained load change using special event in figure above.

Load obtained before special event appearance in reference:

![Load Before Event](img/load-before-event.png)

After adding special event to reference and re-obtaining forecasts, you can notice how number of recalculated contacts changed in next figure â€“ on next tab, number of operators in this period will also be increased:

![Load After Event](img/load-after-event.png)

##### 3.1.7.2 Editing Special Event

To edit special event, click edit button. "Special Event Configuration" window opens. Change parameters described in previous section and save changes.

**Important**: For edited event to apply, forecast must be updated.

##### 3.1.7.3 Deleting Special Event

To delete special event from reference, click delete button.

**Important**: System will only allow deleting special event that was never considered when obtaining forecast.

**Note 1:** System allows creating identical special events in reference. In this case, when obtaining forecasts, coefficient of special event created later is applied.

**Note 2:** System allows creating overlapping events. With such overlapping events in forecasted intervals:
- In non-overlapping segments, load is multiplied by corresponding coefficients
- In overlapping segment â€“ load is multiplied by coefficient of special event created last

#### 3.1.8 Labor Standards Reference {#labor-standards-reference}

The reference is available for viewing to users with "View Labor Standards Reference" access right (System_AccessWorkNorm).

The reference is available for editing to users with "Administrator" system role or any other role with "Edit Labor Standards Reference" access right (System_EditWorkNorm).

This reference configures labor standard parameters considered or not considered when creating work schedule templates and planning work schedules.

To access the reference, open side menu and select "References" â†’ "Labor Standards" tab:

![Labor Standards Reference](img/labor-standards-reference.png)

After accessing the reference, following window is displayed:

![Labor Standards Interface](img/labor-standards-interface.png)

![Labor Standards Details](img/labor-standards-details.png)

**Rest norm** determines number of continuous rest hours for operator per calendar week. For example, if you set 48-hour norm, it means operator must rest two consecutive days. This setting also affects ability to add additional shift to operator in planned work schedule.

When planning and editing schedule, system can behave differently depending on settings. Select most suitable option from proposed:

- **Ignore**: system will plan employee schedules according to their work rules and load, but weekly rest norm may not be observed. During manual corrections, system will allow setting any shift regardless of specified rest norm
- **Consider**: system will plan work schedules with strict rest norm consideration. When attempting manual corrections violating weekly rest norm, user will receive notification about inability to perform this action
- **Warn**: system will plan work schedules with strict rest norm consideration. When attempting manual corrections violating weekly rest norm, user will receive warning that changes violate weekly rest norm
- **Use only during planning**: rest norm will be considered only during work schedule planning. During manual corrections, system will allow setting any shift regardless of specified rest norm â€“ warning won't appear

![Rest Norm Configuration](img/rest-norm-configuration.png)

**Weekly norm** is used to check possibility of adding additional shifts to operator when correcting planned work schedule. When attempting to add additional shift to operator during work schedule planning, system will rely on reference settings and "Weekly hours norm" value in operator card.

When planning and editing schedule, system can behave differently depending on settings. Select most suitable option from proposed:

- **Ignore**: reference setting is ignored, can add shift to employee regardless of their norm
- **Consider**: if additional shift cannot be added to employee due to weekly hours norm excess, user will receive warning and shift won't be assigned
- **Warn**: if additional shift cannot be added to employee due to weekly hours norm excess, user will receive warning and choice: add shift or refuse
- **Consider during planning**: weekly norm will be considered only during work schedule planning, during manual shift addition norm won't be considered (similar to "Ignore" checkbox)

![Weekly Norm Configuration](img/weekly-norm-configuration.png)

**Night time** is used to determine hours considered night time (according to Labor Code from 22:00 â€“ 06:00) and parameters that will determine system behavior when assigning work schedule templates and planning work schedules. These hours work together with individual employee card settings. If employee doesn't have "Night work" parameter set, system will monitor that employee isn't assigned shift overlapping night time specified in reference.

Also specify % night work supplement that will be considered when calculating schedule cost.

Select most suitable option from proposed:

- **Ignore**: night hours not considered
- **Consider**: used when attempting to assign work schedule template to employee individually who doesn't have "Night work" checkbox set, warning appears and schedule isn't assigned. When attempting mass work schedule template assignment, employees without "Night work" checkbox will be grayed out and cannot be selected for template assignment
- **Warn**: during individual work schedule template assignment to employee without "Night work" checkbox, user will see warning about individual settings violation and be offered choice: assign template anyway or not. During mass assignment, behavior is same
- **Use only during planning**: night time will be considered only during work schedule planning, during manual shift addition night time won't be considered, similar to "Ignore" checkbox

![Night Time Configuration](img/night-time-configuration.png)

**Daily norm** determines operator shift duration. System checks shift duration in work schedule template and shift duration set in operator card â€“ operator will get minimum duration from these two values.

Select most suitable system behavior with reference settings:

- **Ignore**: reference settings and individual daily hours value set in operator card not considered
- **Consider**: during work schedule planning, operators will get minimum shift duration value (either reference or individual). During manual shift duration correction, operator's individual duration is also considered. If new shift duration exceeds norm during correction, user will receive warning and duration won't change
- **Warn**: considered during manual shift duration correction. If shift duration exceeds norm, user will receive warning and choice: change duration anyway or refuse
- **Use only during planning**: similar to "Consider" option but without conditions for manual correction

![Daily Norm Configuration](img/daily-norm-configuration.png)

**Accumulated vacation days**. Reference determines whether accumulated vacation days will be considered when manually adding vacation in vacation schedule planning, operator card and formed work schedule.

- **Ignore**: when attempting to add vacation to operator, remaining vacation days number not considered
- **Consider**: when manually adding vacation to operator, remaining vacation days number will be considered. If vacation days insufficient, system will show warning and not assign vacation
- **Warn**: if operator doesn't have enough vacation days, warning will be issued when adding with choice: assign vacation or not

![Vacation Days Configuration](img/vacation-days-configuration.png)

![Vacation Days Settings](img/vacation-days-settings.png)

**Time interval for obtaining accumulated vacation days and method of obtaining these days**

This setting sets time period for which system will take accumulated vacation days from 1C during personnel structure update, and you need to select work hours obtaining option: from 1C or enter work hours manually (either massively or in operator card).

![Vacation Days Interval](img/vacation-days-interval.png)

**Shift exchange periods**. This setting helps avoid payroll calculation period problems for employees.

In this block, you can highlight month date boundaries within which shift exchange/work coverage between employees is possible. Add several periods within month by clicking + and specify date range boundaries within which employees can exchange shifts. When creating shift exchange request, limitation check set in current block will be performed.

Example: shifts can be exchanged from 1st to 14th and from 15th to 31st. In this case, if employee wants to exchange January 10th shift, they must work until January 14th inclusive.

![Exchange Periods](img/exchange-periods.png)

**Allowable overtime hours amount**

This setting helps prevent excessive employee overtime. Specify maximum overtime hours operator can work per week and year. If when setting additional shift in schedule, employee's total overtime hours per week/year exceeds norm specified in reference, system will show warning (if "Warn" is set) or prohibit additional shift setting (if "Consider" is set).

#### 3.1.9 Breaks/Lunches Reference {#breaks-lunches-reference}

The reference is available for viewing to users with "View Labor Standards Reference" access right (System_AccessWorkNorm).

The reference is available for editing to users with "Administrator" system role or any other role with "Edit Labor Standards Reference" access right (System_EditWorkNorm).

![Shift Duration](img/shift-duration.png)

**Shift type**

Specify one of three shift types â€“ day, night and mixed. Shift type depends on night time hours set in "Labor Standards" reference (according to Labor Code from 22:00 â€“ 06:00). Shift type determines ability to set day and night lunches/breaks. For mixed shift, you need to set night duration and day duration â€“ total hours falling on night and day time (see example in figure).

**Note:** For night shift, you can set maximum duration not exceeding total night hours duration set in "Labor Standards": if it's from 22:00 to 6:00, night shift duration cannot be more than 8 hours.

![Shift Type Configuration](img/shift-type-configuration.png)

**Lunch/break order**

Set one of two modes: "Consider lunch/break order" and "Don't consider lunch/break order". Selected mode determines whether system can automatically arrange set lunches/breaks under load in schedule or will follow strict lunch/break order.

**Maximum/minimum time without break**

In maximum and minimum time without break columns, specify time within which employee can be without break. Time without break should be multiple of set system interval.

In "Lunch start interval" field, period from shift beginning when system can plan lunch break for employees is specified.

![Lunch Start Interval](img/lunch-start-interval.png)

**Type**

Set one of two types: lunch or technological break.

**Duration (min)** can only be multiple of initially set system intervals.

**Paid**: checkbox allows considering break in timesheet. For example, if 12-hour shift has 4 breaks: 2 unpaid 30-minute lunches and 2 paid 15-minute technological breaks, then 11 full hours will go to timesheet (for payment).

The reference is available for editing to users with "Administrator" system role or any other role with "Edit Work Schedule Templates reference" access right (System_EditScheduleTemplate).

To account for employees in load forecasting and schedule creation in "ARGUS WFM CC" system, you need to create their cards.

The "Employees" section can be accessed either through "Personnel" tab from sections list menu or from main page by clicking "Employees" block:

![Employees Section Access](img/employees-section-access.png)

![Employees Main Page](img/employees-main-page.png)

By default, system displays only active employees (button pressed). To view all employees (active/deactivated) or only deactivated ones, click corresponding button.

For search convenience, use search: start typing employee name and system will display matches by coincidence, you can also filter operator list by department:

![Employee Search Filter](img/employee-search-filter.png)

In employee list, click on employee of interest. Following information will be displayed to the right of selected employee.

Upper part of card (figure 3.2.1.4):

- Surname, Name, Patronymic
- Personnel number
- Information about whether employee is home operator
- Hire date
- Termination date
- ID (internal and external)
- Position
- Time zone
- Department

![Employee Card Upper](img/employee-card-upper.png)

You can go to department by clicking its name. Also in employee card there's possibility to specify comment in free form that won't be visible to employee themselves.

Employee card consists of following information blocks:

- **Current employee work schedule** â€“ shifts and rotation assigned to employee. Work schedule and rotation are needed to determine employee's work and non-work days. Different colors on schedule show different shifts (light green shifts were assigned manually, red ones automatically planned by System). Same shows employee vacation types and their dates.

![Current Work Schedule](img/current-work-schedule.png)

- **Individual business rules for lunches/breaks** (figure 3.2.1.9) that need to be considered when planning employee work schedule. They're needed so system considers breaks/lunches when planning schedule and automatically places them depending on operator load. Creation logic is similar to "Lunches/Breaks" reference. Individual business rules take precedence over general lunch/break business rules.

![Individual Business Rules](img/individual-business-rules.png)

- **Planned services and groups** that employee can handle. To edit groups list, click gear icon. By checking corresponding checkboxes, select main groups that will be planned first.

![Planned Services Groups](img/planned-services-groups.png)

- **Contacts**: contains contact information for communicating with employee (email address, landline phone, mobile phone, other (e.g., Telegram login)). Specifying email is additional channel for receiving notifications (with appropriate "Notification Schemes" reference and Server configuration).

![Employee Contacts](img/employee-contacts.png)

- **WFM Account**: account that employee will use to access System. When creating, you need to specify login and password. Creation time is recorded automatically. We recommend mandatory password change on first system login. For this, specify any past date in "Password valid until" field.

WFM account can be blocked: manually by clicking gear, when entering wrong password more than 5 times, when receiving termination date through integration and automatic employee card deactivation.

![WFM Account](img/wfm-account.png)

- **Individual settings**: considered when building work schedule.
  - **Rate** indicates whether employee works full workday (e.g., working 40 hours per week in 5/2 schedule is rate 1.0, working 20 hours per week is rate 0.5). Rate participates in work hours calculation (if it comes through integration, not set manually).
  - **Cost** based on which schedule cost will be calculated. Reference value is set in "Bonus Indicators" reference, individual value in employee card.
  - **Night work** shows whether employee will work night time (night time is set in labor standards configuration). If checkbox isn't checked, system cannot assign night shifts to employee.
  - **Weekend work** shows whether employee can be brought to work on their day off.
  - **Overtime work** determines whether system can add work hours above established norm (adding additional shifts, weekend calls, etc.).
  - **Weekly hours norm (in hours)** â€“ value setting allowable operator work limit per week. Considered when adding additional shifts during work schedule planning; comes through integration.
  - **Daily hours norm (in hours)** overrides daily shift duration during work schedule planning, i.e., if employee has 7 hours per day and work schedule template has 9-hour shift, employee will get 7-hour shift during work schedule planning; comes through integration.

![Individual Settings](img/individual-settings.png)

**Note**: By default, settings in "Labor Standards" reference are set to "Ignore", i.e., by default values specified in individual settings won't be considered; rate will equal one.

- **External system accounts**: attached to employee through integration or manually (through account mapping on "Personnel" â†’ "Personnel Synchronization" page).

![External System Accounts](img/external-system-accounts.png)

- **Vacations**: combination of consecutive days that employee can take as desired vacation (with checkbox checked). Vacation scheme is created on "References" â†’ "Vacation Scheme" page, massively assigned on "Personnel" â†’ "Business Rules" tab.

![Employee Vacations](img/employee-vacations.png)

- **Schedule**: shows employee's shifts, lunches/breaks and events (see "Current Schedule") according to which they should work. Schedule can also be seen in personal cabinet and exported to Excel.

![Employee Schedule](img/employee-schedule.png)

- **Work hours**: shows number of hours operator should work for specific period (year, quarter, month â€“ depending on system setting). Work hours can be assigned manually through card or "Personnel" â†’ "Work Hours" page, and also received automatically through integration with ERP system (e.g., 1C:Payroll).

![Employee Work Hours](img/employee-work-hours.png)

- **Work rules**: show start, duration and shift rotation for selected time period.

On "Shift Rotations" tab, you can check checkboxes:
  - **Assigned**: rotations that system considers when planning work schedule. If several are selected, any of them is chosen depending on need.
  - **Wishes**: rotations that will be prioritized when planning work schedule. Wish can be marked by operator themselves in personal cabinet (from all checkboxes in this area only this one is available to them), or can be set by senior operator or administrator.
  - **Lock scheme**: only this rotation will be used for work schedule planning.

![Work Rules](img/work-rules.png)

- **Roles**: responsible for access rights to System functionality. Each role can be configured by User so employees see only blocks from their responsibility area (see "Roles" Reference).

![Employee Roles](img/employee-roles.png)

- **Skills**: used when filtering employees in schedule, monitoring and reporting. You can specify level (beginner, intermediate, champion) and English language proficiency attribute (yes, no).

**Important!** Skills don't affect planning processes.

![Employee Skills](img/employee-skills.png)

##### 3.2.1.1 Creating and Editing Employee Card

If selected period included several special events, uncheck those that shouldn't be deleted.

To confirm special event deletion, click confirm button, to cancel â€“ cancel button.

**Adding Vacation**

Operator can add desired vacation in personal cabinet if assigned System_EditMyPlannedVacation access right.

Manager or any other user with System_AddVacationWithoutChecks access right can assign planned vacation and unscheduled vacation.

Vacations have three types:
- **Desired vacation**: set by operator themselves in their personal cabinet (same as operator card). Is operator's wish for vacation dates, considered when planning vacation
- **Planned vacation**: planned by system under load based on operator's desired vacation or set by operator's manager after reviewing operator's wish or without review. This vacation type is considered when planning work schedules and vacations
- **Unscheduled vacation**: unplanned vacation (unpaid vacation, vacation at own expense, sick leave vacation, etc.) set by manager. Considered when planning vacations and work schedules

To add Desired vacation, right-click any date in tabular or calendar view, then "Add event" and select Desired vacation:

![Add Desired Vacation](img/add-desired-vacation.png)

In opened window, select "Vacation scheme", vacation creation method ("Period" or "Calendar days"), specify vacation dates according to "Vacation schemes".

**Note**: When setting vacations according to "Vacation schemes", there's no need to follow vacation sequence set in selected scheme, it's sufficient to follow total number of vacations and days in vacations.

If "Period" vacation creation method is selected:
- Need to specify vacation start and end date
- Vacation doesn't shift if holidays fall in its period (e.g., vacation set from 25.04 to 08.05. Despite one holiday falling in this period: "May 1", vacation doesn't shift. Work return date â€“ 09.05)
- From accumulated vacation days, number of days considering holidays is subtracted (e.g., vacation set for 14 days with 1 holiday in period. 13 days are subtracted from accumulated days, not 14)

If "Calendar days" vacation creation method is selected:
- Need to specify vacation start date and number of vacation days (vacation end date will be pulled automatically)
- Vacation shifts by number of holidays (e.g., vacation set for 14 calendar days from 25.04 to 08.05. This period includes one holiday "May 1", so vacation shifts to 09.05. But "May 9" is also holiday, so vacation shifts again. Work return date â€“ 11.05)
- From accumulated vacation days, number of days without considering holidays is subtracted (in above example, 14 vacation days will be subtracted from accumulated days)

**Note**: When selecting vacation dates, consider individual vacation scheme settings. If they are violated, user will receive warning and vacation won't be assigned. However, if manager assigns vacation, they'll get "Confirm" button to assign schedule bypassing operator's personal vacation settings. Also consider "Accumulated vacation days" setting from "Labor Standards" reference. If vacation is set exceeding accumulated days, depending on settings system will either allow assigning such vacation, show warning and not assign vacation, or show warning and offer to assign vacation anyway.

When setting vacation dates, user is helped by field showing accumulated vacation days number â€“ number of vacation days remaining for operator after assigning vacation dates. Days number comes through 1C integration. Example: operator has 10 vacation days remaining on 01.06.2018. Once vacation is set from 01.06.2018 to 07.06.2018, they'll have 3 vacation days left and same value will be displayed in "Accumulated days number" field.

Without 1C integration, accumulated vacation days number can be entered by script through database by ARGUS NTC specialists, but most often this field is ignored in such cases.

After filling all data, confirm vacation creation or cancel changes. After creating vacation, it can be seen by setting "Desired vacation" filter (if desired vacation was created) or "Planned vacation" filter (if planned vacation was created) in tabular mode.

![Vacation Filter](img/vacation-filter.png)

**Unscheduled Vacation**

To add unscheduled vacation, right-click needed date in tabular or calendar mode and click "Add event" and select "Unscheduled vacation" event:

![Add Unscheduled Vacation](img/add-unscheduled-vacation.png)

When selecting "Unscheduled vacation" type, specify vacation start and end date in dialog. If there's additional setting, fill "Comment" field.

When adding "Unscheduled vacation" to employee, accumulated vacation days are not subtracted.

![Unscheduled Vacation Details](img/unscheduled-vacation-details.png)

##### 3.2.1.3 Viewing Work Hours Statistics for Current Period, Individual Work Hours Standard Correction

Correction actions are available to users with "Administrator" role or any other role with "Assign work hours for period in employee card" access right (System_EditWorkerNormHours).

**Work hours** â€“ number of hours operator should work during reporting period.

Each operator can have their own work hours, so WFM CC system implements possibility to set work hours standard individually (see below) and massively (3.2.6. Mass Work Hours Assignment).

**Reporting period** â€“ period for which operator should work their work hours.

To calculate work hours by standard and work hours by schedule in "Work hours by years" area, select needed year:

![Work Hours By Years](img/work-hours-by-years.png)

Below year selection, table with following data will be displayed:
- **Period**: current reporting period
- **Standard**: number of hours operator should work during reporting period in current month
- **By schedule**: number of work hours in shift (according to work schedule assigned to employee) and all work call wishes (if operator is home) for current month reporting period

![Work Hours Table](img/work-hours-table.png)

Values in this table are displayed according to setting in "Mass Work Hours Assignment" section. In cases of individual operator work hours, system allows correcting them in this table.

To assign individual work hours standard, select needed year, left-click on "Work hours" column and specify hours in HH:M format in available input fields (e.g., 1972:0 if work hours are annual).

To get work hours standard from 1C through integration, select year for which to get work hours and click get button.

![Get Work Hours](img/get-work-hours.png)

If work hours were previously received for operator for entire year, but after receiving value they resign (same year), to update work hours value need to re-request it in 1C by clicking get button.

##### 3.2.1.4 Employee Deactivation and Activation

To deactivate employee card, select them in list and click "Deactivate employee" button. If employee has account for system login, it's automatically blocked upon deactivation.

![Deactivate Employee](img/deactivate-employee.png)

**Example**: If employee went on extended vacation, sick leave or maternity leave, and senior operator finds it inconvenient that they're displayed in employee list, senior operator can deactivate employee.

**Important!** When employee who needs to be deactivated participates in current schedule at deactivation moment and after, then:

1) In deactivated employee's work schedule after deactivation, shifts will be displayed according to current schedule
2) When creating schedule that intersects current schedule, deactivated employee will be displayed in new schedule. To prevent this, after employee deactivation, coordinator should update current schedule with "Update only changed intervals" parameter

To restore (activate) previously deactivated employee, select them in list and click "Activate employee" button. Since employee account is blocked upon deactivation, after restoring such employee, their account needs to be unblocked:

![Activate Employee](img/activate-employee.png)

**Example**: If employee returned from maternity leave, their card needs to be activated.

##### 3.2.1.5 Shift Exchange

Operator can exchange shifts or vacation with other operators. For shift exchange, work schedule must be planned. Exchange request is created from operator's personal card:

![Shift Exchange](img/shift-exchange.png)

If viewed by employee who can accept shift exchange request:

![Can Accept Exchange](img/can-accept-exchange.png)

If viewed by operator themselves:

![Own Exchange Request](img/own-exchange-request.png)

Operator can cancel shift exchange request by clicking cancel button. They see not only their request but also requests from operators in same parent department.

When shift exchange request appears, any operator from same parent department who has matching rest and work days with exchange wish and same shift duration can agree to shift exchange.

If shift exchange request is confirmed by another operator, request is displayed to employee manager. Manager needs to either confirm or reject exchange request. In manager's personal cabinet, exchange request is displayed as follows:

![Manager Exchange View](img/manager-exchange-view.png)

If shift exchange request is confirmed by department manager, request status changes to "Confirmed".

![Confirmed Exchange](img/confirmed-exchange.png)

If request is rejected, status changes to "rejected":

![Rejected Exchange](img/rejected-exchange.png)

**Important!** If operator has exchange request in "Not confirmed", "Confirmed", "Awaiting confirmation" statuses, they cannot agree to other requests where "Required replacement date" and/or "Work date" match.

##### 3.2.1.6 Vacation Exchange

Operators can exchange vacations through personal cabinet. Functionality is similar to shift exchange. Operators exchanging vacations must be in same department and vacation days number must match. Only planned vacations can be exchanged. To exchange vacation, go to personal cabinet, select your approved vacation and click "Vacation exchange":

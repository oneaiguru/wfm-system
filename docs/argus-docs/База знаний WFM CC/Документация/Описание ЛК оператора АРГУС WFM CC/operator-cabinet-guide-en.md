You can also quickly navigate to the current date by clicking the "Today" button.

*Figure 2.2.2 - Today Navigation Button*

When clicking on a shift in the calendar, you can view detailed information about it. You can also change the display mode to weekly/daily/4-day view. In this case, you get the ability to view your schedule within the shift (lunches, breaks, events, channel types).

## 3. Requests Page

On the requests page, you can view your own (1) and available (2) requests created in the system by other employees.

## 6. Preferences Page

### 6.1 Work Rules Preferences

On the "Preferences" → "Work Rules" page, you can view the work rules assigned to you (2) for the specified period (1).

![Work Rules Preferences](img/work_rules_preferences.png)
*Figure 6.1.1 - Work Rules Preferences Page*

You can switch to the "Rotations" tab (1) in the work rule and select preferred rotation schemes (2). Then click the "Apply" button (3).

Marked preferences for rotation schemes do not guarantee that the system will assign shifts according to this specific scheme, as the system primarily focuses on contact center workload. Also, if you have one of the schemes assigned to you, preferences will not be considered, and shifts will be planned according to the assigned rotation scheme.

![Rotation Preferences](img/rotation_preferences_tab.png)
*Figure 6.1.2 - Rotation Preferences Configuration*

### 6.2 Desired Vacations

On the "Preferences" → "Desired Vacations" page, you can specify the desired vacation scheme if it is assigned to you (1), and specify desired vacation dates (by clicking on dates in the calendar). After that, you need to click the "Save" button (2).

The "New" tab displays acknowledgments that have not yet been confirmed. To confirm acknowledgments, you need to click the "Acknowledged" button.

## 8. Exchange Page

On the "Exchange" page, you can respond to offers created on this exchange. To do this, you need to go to the "Available" tab (1) and select an offer that interests you, review the information about the additional shift, and then click the "Accept" button (2).

![Exchange Available Offers](img/exchange_available_offers.png)
*Figure 8.1 - Available Exchange Offers*

Next, a modal window will appear where you can add a comment to the offer and click the "Confirm" button for final confirmation.

![Exchange Confirmation Modal](img/exchange_confirmation_modal.png)

The offer is now displayed on the "My" tab with "Open" status until the supervisor confirms the response. You can also decline the offer by clicking the "Cancel" button.

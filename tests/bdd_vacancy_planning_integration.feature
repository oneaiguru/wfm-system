# BDD Feature: Vacancy Planning Module UI-API Integration

Feature: Vacancy Planning Complete Integration
  As a workforce planning analyst
  I want seamless integration between vacancy planning UI and APIs
  So that staffing analysis and planning operates effectively

  Background:
    Given I have System_AccessVacancyPlanning role
    And vacancy planning APIs are available at "/api/v1/vacancy-planning/*"
    And the Vacancy Planning Module is accessible at "/vacancy-planning"

  @access-control @security @roles
  Scenario: Access Control and Security Validation
    Given I navigate to "/vacancy-planning"
    When the system checks my permissions
    Then it should validate System_AccessVacancyPlanning role
    And access should be granted to authorized users
    And unauthorized users should be redirected
    And security audit should be logged

  @settings @configuration @preferences
  Scenario: Vacancy Planning Settings Management
    Given I access the vacancy planning settings
    When I configure the following parameters:
      | minimumVacancyEfficiency | 85          |
      | analysisPeriod          | 90 days     |
      | forecastConfidence      | 95%         |
      | workRuleOptimization    | true        |
      | integrationWithExchange | enabled     |
    Then settings should be saved via PUT "/api/v1/vacancy-planning/settings"
    And configuration should be validated
    And analysis parameters should be updated

  @analysis @execution @monitoring
  Scenario: Gap Analysis Execution and Monitoring
    Given valid planning settings are configured
    When I start a new vacancy analysis
    And I select analysis parameters:
      | departments | All Call Centers    |
      | timeframe   | Next 6 months      |
      | scenarios   | Base, Optimistic   |
    Then analysis should execute via POST "/api/v1/vacancy-planning/analysis"
    And progress should be tracked in real-time
    And task completion should be monitored
    And results should be generated automatically

  @real-time @progress @tasks
  Scenario: Real-time Analysis Progress Tracking
    Given vacancy analysis is running
    When I monitor the analysis dashboard
    Then I should see real-time progress updates
    And task status should show:
      | LoadHistoricalData      | Completed |
      | CalculateCurrentGaps    | Running   |
      | GenerateForecast        | Pending   |
      | AnalyzeSkillRequirements| Pending   |
      | CalculateCosts          | Pending   |
      | GenerateRecommendations | Pending   |
    And progress percentage should be accurate
    And estimated completion time should be displayed

  @results @visualization @reporting
  Scenario: Analysis Results and Visualization
    Given vacancy analysis has completed successfully
    When I review the results dashboard
    Then I should see comprehensive visualizations:
      | gapsByDepartment     | Chart with staffing shortages |
      | slaImpactAnalysis    | Service level impact metrics  |
      | costAnalysis         | Hiring cost projections       |
      | timelineProjections  | Staffing needs over time      |
    And drill-down functionality should be available
    And export options should be provided

  @recommendations @hiring @categorization
  Scenario: Hiring Recommendations Generation
    Given analysis results are available
    When I access hiring recommendations
    Then recommendations should be categorized by:
      | immediate   | Critical shortage positions |
      | planned     | Anticipated needs          |
      | contingency | Backup requirements        |
      | skill-based | Specific competency gaps   |
    And each recommendation should include:
      | position     | Job title and requirements |
      | urgency      | Timeline for hiring       |
      | budget       | Cost implications         |
      | impact       | Business impact if unfilled|

  @exchange @integration @synchronization
  Scenario: Exchange System Integration
    Given 1C ZUP exchange system is configured
    When I trigger data synchronization
    Then vacancy data should be transferred via "/api/v1/vacancy-planning/exchange"
    And bidirectional sync should occur
    And data consistency should be maintained
    And error handling should manage failures

  @personnel @synchronization @data-integrity
  Scenario: Personnel System Synchronization
    Given personnel data changes occur
    When vacancy planning updates are needed
    Then synchronization should trigger automatically
    And employee data should be current
    And skill matrices should be updated
    And planning assumptions should be refreshed

  @reporting @trends @analytics
  Scenario: Comprehensive Reporting and Trend Analysis
    Given historical vacancy data exists
    When I generate comprehensive reports
    Then reports should include:
      | trendAnalysis    | Historical staffing patterns |
      | forecastAccuracy | Prediction vs actual results |
      | costAnalysis     | ROI and budget impact        |
      | slaCorrelation   | Service level relationships  |
    And reports should be exportable to Excel/PDF
    And automated delivery should be configurable

  @scenarios @modeling @planning
  Scenario: What-if Scenario Modeling
    Given base analysis is complete
    When I create what-if scenarios:
      | scenario     | description                  |
      | Growth+20%   | 20% volume increase         |
      | SkillShift   | Changed skill requirements  |
      | BudgetCut    | 15% hiring budget reduction |
    Then each scenario should be modeled
    And comparative analysis should be provided
    And recommendations should be adjusted accordingly

  @multi-site @locations @coordination
  Scenario: Multi-site Analysis Support
    Given multiple site locations exist
    When I perform cross-site analysis
    Then each location should be analyzed independently
    And cross-site movement opportunities should be identified
    And regional coordination should be considered
    And site-specific constraints should be respected

  @validation @error-handling @quality
  Scenario: Data Validation and Error Handling
    Given invalid or incomplete data exists
    When analysis is attempted
    Then data quality issues should be identified
    And validation errors should be clearly reported
    And guidance should be provided for resolution
    And partial analysis should be supported where possible

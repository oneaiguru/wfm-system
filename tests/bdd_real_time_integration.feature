# BDD Feature: Real-time Monitoring UI-API Integration

Feature: Real-time Monitoring and Operational Control
  As an operations supervisor
  I want real-time monitoring integration between UI and APIs
  So that operational control is immediate and accurate

  Background:
    Given real-time monitoring APIs are available
    And operational control dashboard is accessible at "/monitoring/operational"
    And WebSocket connections are supported

  @websocket @connection @real-time
  Scenario: WebSocket Connection Establishment
    Given I access the operational monitoring dashboard
    When the system establishes real-time connections
    Then WebSocket should connect to "ws://localhost:8000/ws"
    And connection status should be confirmed
    And automatic reconnection should be configured
    And connection health should be monitored

  @metrics @dashboard @operational
  Scenario: Six Key Operational Metrics Display
    Given operational data is available
    When I view the monitoring dashboard
    Then I should see six key metrics:
      | serviceLevel    | Current SLA performance    | Traffic light indicator |
      | queueLength     | Waiting calls/chats       | Real-time count        |
      | agentsAvailable | Available agent count     | Status breakdown       |
      | responseTime    | Average response time     | Trend graph            |
      | callsPerHour    | Hourly call volume       | Comparison to target   |
      | occupancyRate   | Agent utilization rate   | Efficiency indicator   |
    And metrics should update every 30 seconds
    And visual indicators should reflect current status

  @traffic-light @indicators @thresholds
  Scenario: Traffic Light Status Indicators
    Given operational thresholds are configured
    When metrics reach different levels
    Then traffic light indicators should display:
      | Green  | All metrics within acceptable range    |
      | Yellow | One or more metrics approaching limits |
      | Red    | Critical thresholds exceeded          |
    And color changes should be immediate
    And alerts should be triggered appropriately

  @agents @status @monitoring
  Scenario: Agent Status Monitoring
    Given agents are actively working
    When I access agent status monitoring via "/api/v1/monitoring/agents"
    Then I should see real-time agent information:
      | agentId      | Unique identifier    |
      | status       | Available/Busy/Break |
      | currentQueue | Assigned queue       |
      | loginTime    | Session start time   |
      | callsHandled | Current session count|
    And queue filtering should be available
    And agent performance metrics should be current

  @drill-down @detailed @analysis
  Scenario: Drill-down Metric Analysis
    Given high-level metrics are displayed
    When I click on any metric for detailed view
    Then drill-down analysis should open
    And 24-hour trend data should be displayed
    And comparative analysis should be available
    And historical context should be provided

  @alerts @notifications @escalation
  Scenario: Real-time Alert System
    Given alert thresholds are configured
    When operational metrics exceed limits
    Then alerts should be generated immediately
    And notification channels should be activated:
      | Visual  | Dashboard indicators |
      | Audio   | Alert sounds        |
      | Email   | Supervisor alerts   |
      | SMS     | Critical escalation |
    And escalation procedures should follow defined paths

  @mobile @monitoring @responsive
  Scenario: Mobile Monitoring Interface
    Given I access monitoring from mobile device
    When I navigate to "/monitoring/mobile"
    Then mobile-optimized interface should load
    And key metrics should be clearly visible
    And touch-friendly controls should be available
    And offline capability should be supported

  @schedule @changes @notifications
  Scenario: Schedule Change Notifications
    Given schedule modifications occur in the system
    When I monitor schedule changes via "/api/v1/schedules/current"
    Then real-time schedule updates should appear
    And affected employees should be identified
    And impact on coverage should be calculated
    And supervisor notifications should be sent

  @performance @optimization @monitoring
  Scenario: Performance Monitoring and Optimization
    Given monitoring system is under load
    When concurrent users access real-time data
    Then system performance should remain stable
    And response times should stay under 500ms
    And WebSocket connections should handle load
    And resource utilization should be monitored

  @predictive @alerts @proactive
  Scenario: Predictive Alert Generation
    Given historical patterns are analyzed
    When trends indicate potential issues
    Then predictive alerts should be generated:
      | ServiceLevel | Approaching SLA threshold  |
      | QueueBuildup | Unusual queue growth rate  |
      | AgentShortage| Insufficient coverage     |
    And proactive recommendations should be provided
    And preventive actions should be suggested

  @integration @external @systems
  Scenario: External System Integration
    Given external monitoring systems exist
    When real-time data flows between systems
    Then API integrations should be stable
    And data consistency should be maintained
    And failure recovery should be automatic
    And audit trails should be preserved

  @customization @dashboards @preferences
  Scenario: Dashboard Customization
    Given user preferences are configurable
    When I customize the monitoring dashboard
    Then metric arrangements should be savable
    And alert thresholds should be adjustable
    And color schemes should be selectable
    And personal preferences should persist

  @historical @data @analysis
  Scenario: Historical Data Integration
    Given real-time data is being collected
    When I request historical analysis
    Then past performance data should be accessible
    And trend analysis should be available
    And comparative reporting should be generated
    And data retention policies should be enforced

  @offline @resilience @recovery
  Scenario: Offline Resilience and Recovery
    Given network connectivity is interrupted
    When real-time monitoring is affected
    Then cached data should be displayed with indicators
    And automatic reconnection should attempt recovery
    And data synchronization should resume when possible
    And no critical data should be lost

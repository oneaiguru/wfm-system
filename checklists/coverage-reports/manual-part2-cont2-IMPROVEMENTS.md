**Priority:** Critical
**Lines to Add:** New scenario section (recommend lines 550-650)

```gherkin
@vacancy_planning @personnel_optimization
Scenario: Automatic Optimal Personnel Calculation
  Given I am logged in as a planning specialist
  And I have access to the Vacancy Planning module
  When I navigate to "Planning" → "Vacancy Planning"
  Then I should see vacancy planning interface with:
    | Component | Function | Requirement |
    | Multi-skill template selector | Choose planning template | Required |
    | Planning period specification | Define calculation period | Required |
    | Minimum efficiency configuration | Set vacancy efficiency threshold | Optional (default 80%) |
    | Break percentage consideration | Account for break time | Optional (default 15%) |
    | Work rules integration | Apply existing work rules | Automatic |
  When I click "Calculate Optimal Personnel"
  Then the system should:
    | Calculation Step | Process | Validation |
    | Analyze forecasted load | Process demand patterns | Load data completeness |
    | Apply work rules | Consider shift constraints | Rule compliance |
    | Factor break percentages | Account for non-productive time | Percentage validation |

  When I create a new vacancy planning task:
    | Field | Value | Purpose |
    | Task name | Q1 2025 Vacancy Analysis | Identification |
    | Planning period | 2025-01-01 to 2025-03-31 | Scope definition |
    | Break percentage | 18% | Non-productive time |
    | Minimum efficiency | 85% | Quality threshold |
    | Consider work schedules | Yes | Integration flag |
  And I select available work rules for the calculation
  Then the task should appear in "Vacancy Planning Tasks" list
  And task monitoring should show:
    | Status | Description | Next Action |
    | Queued | Task waiting for execution | System processing |
    | Executing | Calculation in progress | Wait for completion |
    | Completed | Results available | Review results |
    | Error | Calculation failed | Check parameters |
```

### 2. Applied Schedule Copy and Editing Workflow
**Target File:** `09-work-schedule-vacation-planning.feature`
**Priority:** High
**Lines to Add:** New scenario section (recommend lines 245-295)

```gherkin
@schedule_editing @applied_schedule_restrictions
Scenario: Applied Schedule Editing Restrictions and Copy Creation
  Given I have an applied work schedule that is currently active
  When I attempt to edit the applied schedule directly
  Then the system should display editing restrictions:
    | Restriction Type | Message | Reason |
    | Direct editing disabled | "Cannot edit applied schedule directly" | Data integrity |
    | Copy required | "Create copy to make changes" | Version control |
    | Active protection | "Applied schedule is in use" | Operational continuity |
  And I should see a "Create Copy for Editing" button
  When I click "Create Copy for Editing"
  Then a schedule copying dialog should appear with:
    | Dialog Element | Content | Purpose |
    | Title | "Create Schedule Copy" | Dialog identification |
    | Source schedule | Original schedule name (read-only) | Source reference |
    | New schedule name | Auto-generated name (editable) | Version identification |
    | Copy description | Optional description field | Documentation |
    | Options | Include/exclude vacation assignments | Scope control |
  When I configure the copy parameters and click "Create Copy"
  Then a new schedule variant should be created
  And it should be available for editing in the schedule variants list
  And the original applied schedule should remain unchanged and active

@schedule_copying @editing_workflow
Scenario: Work Schedule Copy Dialog and Configuration
  Given I need to create an editable copy of a schedule
  When the schedule copying dialog opens
  Then I should be able to configure:
    | Configuration Option | Choices | Impact |
    | Copy type | Full copy / Partial copy | Scope of duplication |
    | Include vacation assignments | Yes / No | Vacation data copying |
    | Include employee assignments | Yes / No | Staff assignment copying |
    | Include special events | Yes / No | Event data copying |
    | Copy period | Full period / Date range | Temporal scope |
  And validation should ensure:
    | Validation Check | Requirement | Error Message |
    | Unique name | Schedule name not already used | "Schedule name already exists" |
    | Valid period | Date range within planning bounds | "Invalid date range" |
    | Template consistency | Same multi-skill template | "Template mismatch" |
  When copy creation completes successfully
  Then the new schedule should be immediately available for editing
  And all specified components should be included in the copy
```

### 3. UI Interaction Patterns and Visual Elements
**Target File:** `25-ui-ux-improvements.feature`
**Priority:** Medium
**Lines to Add:** New scenario section (recommend lines 300-400)

## Integration Requirements

### Cross-Feature Dependencies
1. **Vacancy Planning ↔ Schedule Planning**: Ensure vacancy calculations integrate with existing schedule planning workflows
2. **Copy Creation ↔ Business Process**: Applied schedule copying should trigger appropriate approval workflows
3. **UI Interactions ↔ Real-time Updates**: Visual changes should immediately reflect in backend data
4. **Statistics ↔ Performance Monitoring**: Enhanced visualizations should integrate with existing performance tracking

### Testing Validation Points
1. **Data Integrity**: All copy operations must maintain referential integrity
2. **Performance**: UI interactions must remain responsive under load
3. **Security**: Editing restrictions must be consistently enforced
4. **Audit Trail**: All modifications must be properly logged

## Implementation Priority
1. **Phase 1 (Critical)**: Vacancy planning module foundation
2. **Phase 2 (High)**: Applied schedule copy workflows
3. **Phase 3 (Medium)**: UI interaction enhancements
4. **Phase 4 (Low)**: Advanced visualization features

## Quality Assurance Notes
- All new scenarios must include Russian translation elements
- Error handling scenarios required for each new feature
- Performance benchmarks must be established for interactive features
- Accessibility requirements must be considered for all UI enhancements

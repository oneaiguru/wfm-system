## METHODOLOGY LESSONS LEARNED

### ‚ùå **What Caused the Initial Underestimate:**
1. **File Scope Limitation**: Only searched 4 files vs 75 total files
2. **Language Bias**: English-only search missed Russian implementations
3. **Surface-Level Search**: Scenario names only, missed embedded logic
4. **Terminology Gaps**: Missed synonyms like "bulk" vs "mass" assignment
5. **Directory Blindness**: Ignored argus-replica and 1010-custom implementations

### ‚úÖ **What the Comprehensive Search Revealed:**
1. **Distributed Implementation**: Features spread across multiple files
2. **Bilingual Specifications**: Extensive Russian terminology usage
3. **Embedded Business Logic**: Rich data tables and step details
4. **Alternative Terminology**: Multiple ways to express same concepts
5. **Enterprise Architecture**: Complete integration and error handling

### üéØ **Best Practices for Future Coverage Analysis:**
1. **Search ALL files** in all directories
2. **Use bilingual keywords** with synonyms and variations
3. **Analyze complete scenario content**, not just names
4. **Check embedded business logic** in data tables and steps
5. **Validate findings** against enterprise requirements

## AFTER: Proposed BDD Additions

### Addition 1: [Feature Name] Scenario
**Location**: Add after line [X] in [target-bdd-file].feature

```gherkin
  @tag1 @tag2 @priority
  Scenario: [Descriptive Scenario Name]

      | Validation Type | Rule | Error Response |
      | [validation1] | [rule] | [error message] |
      | [validation2] | [rule] | [error message] |
    And [edge cases should be handled]:
      | Edge Case | Handling | Result |
      | [case1] | [handling] | [expected result] |
      | [case2] | [handling] | [expected result] |
```

### Addition 2: [Next Feature Name] Scenario
**Location**: Add after line [Y] in [target-bdd-file].feature

```gherkin
  @tag1 @tag2 @priority

## Implementation Guide for Coding Agent

### Step 1: Identify Target File
- File: `[full-path-to-target-bdd-file]`
- Backup the original file first

### Step 2: Add Scenarios in Order
1. Add [Feature 1] after line [X] ([reason for placement])
2. Add [Feature 2] after line [Y] ([reason for placement])
3. Add [Feature 3] after line [Z] ([reason for placement])

### Step 3: Validation
- Ensure proper Gherkin syntax
- Maintain consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Use appropriate tags (@tag1 @tag2)
- Include data tables with pipes (|)
- Add business context in comments

### Step 4: Testing Impact
These additions will require:
- [Type of test data needed]
- [Test environment requirements]
- [Validation procedures]

### Step 5: Documentation Update
Update the main BDD coverage report to show:
- Changed from [X]% to [Y]% coverage
- All missing features now addressed
- Enhanced partial features to complete

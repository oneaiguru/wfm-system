The user is asking for comprehensive documentation about the Vacancy Planning Module in ARGUS WFM. Based on my searches, I've found several key pieces of information:

1. The Vacancy Planning Module is documented in the main user manual (argus-wfm-manual-part2-en.md), specifically in Section 9 starting at page 344 (lines 2590-2669 in the original documentation the user mentioned)
2. The module is documented across pages 344-349 in the manual
3. There are related features like Work Schedule Planning (Section 7), Timetable Planning (Section 8), and the Exchange system (Section 10)

Let me compile a comprehensive response with all the information they requested.

Based on my search of the ARGUS WFM documentation, here's the comprehensive information about the Vacancy Planning Module:

## 1. **Full List of Documentation Files Containing Vacancy Planning Features:**

### Primary Documentation:

- **argus-wfm-manual-part2-en.md** - Main user manual containing the Vacancy Planning Module
- **argus-wfm-manual-part1-en.md** - Contains table of contents referencing Vacancy Planning
- **user-manual-mobile-en.md** - Mobile user guide with vacancy planning references

### Related Documentation:

- **planning-workflows-en.md** - Planning and scheduling workflows
- **admin-guide-en.md** - Administrator guide with system configuration

## 2. **Exact Line Ranges Where Vacancy Planning is Documented:**

### Main Vacancy Planning Module (argus-wfm-manual-part2-en.md):

- **Pages 344-349** (Section 9: Vacancy Planning)
- **Page 344**: Module overview and access rights
- **Pages 345-346**: Planning settings and configuration
- **Page 347**: Task execution and status monitoring
- **Page 348**: Results analysis and decision-making
- **Page 349**: Transition to Exchange system

### References in Other Documents:

- Table of Contents references in multiple files listing "9. Vacancy Planning"

## 3. **Cross-References to Related Features:**

### Direct Dependencies:

- **Work Schedule Planning** (Section 7) - Vacancy planning relies on current work schedules
- **Multi-skill Planning Templates** (Section 6) - Used as basis for vacancy calculations
- **Load Forecasting** (Section 4) - Provides demand data for vacancy calculations
- **Timetable Planning** (Section 8) - Works in conjunction with vacancy planning

### Integration Points:

- **Exchange System** (Section 10) - Shift offers can be created based on vacancy needs
- **Personnel Management** (Section 3.2) - Employee data and structure
- **Business Process Management** - Approval workflows for new positions

## 4. **Priority Assessment:**

The Vacancy Planning Module appears to be a **CORE FEATURE** based on:

- Dedicated section in main user manual
- Listed prominently in all table of contents
- Required system role access rights (System_AccessVacancyPlanning)
- Direct integration with other core planning modules

## 5. **Integration Points - How Vacancy Planning Connects:**

### Input Dependencies:

1. **Multi-skill Planning Templates** - Defines which groups/skills to analyze
2. **Current Work Schedules** - Provides baseline staffing data
3. **Load Forecasts** - Determines staffing requirements
4. **Work Rules** - Defines shift patterns for new positions
5. **Break Percentages** - Factors in non-productive time

### System Calculations:

- **Minimum Vacancy Efficiency** - Calculates optimal coverage percentage
- **Deficit Analysis** - Compares forecast needs vs. current staffing
- **Work Rule Optimization** - Suggests best shift patterns for gaps

### Output Integration:

1. **Hiring Requirements** - Specific positions and shifts needed
2. **Staffing Gap Reports** - Visual charts showing deficits/surpluses
3. **Decision Support** - Data for staff expansion/reduction decisions
4. **Exchange System** - Can create shift offers for identified gaps

### Key Workflow:

1. System analyzes forecast vs. current staffing
2. Identifies deficit periods and coverage gaps
3. Calculates optimal number of new positions needed
4. Suggests specific work rules and shift patterns
5. Provides visual analysis for management decisions
6. Can feed into hiring pipeline and shift exchange systems

The module is designed to automate workforce expansion planning by calculating exactly how many new operators are needed, when they should work, and which work rules would best cover identified gaps in coverage.

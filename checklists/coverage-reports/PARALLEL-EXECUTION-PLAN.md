## ðŸ“Š **Coordination & Progress Tracking**

### **Agent Status Dashboard:**
```
Agent-DB      [ðŸ”„ READY] â†’ database-structure-* files
Agent-API     [ðŸ”„ READY] â†’ rest-api-integration-* files  
Agent-PLAN    [ðŸ”„ READY] â†’ planning-workflows-* files
Agent-ADMIN   [ðŸ”„ READY] â†’ admin-guide-* files
Agent-MANUAL1 [ðŸ”„ READY] â†’ manual-part1-* files
```

### **Progress Milestones:**
- **25%**: All agents started, initial analysis begun
- **50%**: Coverage reports completed  
- **75%**: Improvements specifications completed
- **100%**: Implementation diffs completed, validation passed

### **Expected Timeline:**
- **Agent Startup**: 5 minutes (parallel launch)
- **Analysis Phase**: 30-45 minutes per agent 
- **Report Generation**: 15-20 minutes per agent
- **Quality Validation**: 10 minutes
- **Total Estimated**: 60-90 minutes for complete coverage verification

## ðŸ”§ **Execution Monitoring Commands**

### **Launch All Agents (Parallel):**
```bash
# Run all 5 agents simultaneously in separate terminals/sessions
# Copy each agent command from above and execute in parallel

# Monitor progress:
watch -n 30 'ls -la coverage-reports/*.md | wc -l'
```

### **Progress Tracking:**
```bash
# Check completion status
ls coverage-reports/ | grep -E "(COVERAGE|IMPROVEMENTS|DIFF)" | wc -l
# Expected: 15 files when complete (3 files Ã— 5 agents)

# Check file sizes (indicates content)
ls -la coverage-reports/ | grep -E "(COVERAGE|IMPROVEMENTS|DIFF)"

# Validate quality
grep -c "Coverage:" coverage-reports/*-COVERAGE.md
grep -c "INSERT" coverage-reports/*-DIFF.md
```

### **Quality Validation:**
```bash
# Check all required sections present
for file in coverage-reports/*-COVERAGE.md; do
  echo "=== $file ==="
  grep -c "Summary\|Detailed Coverage\|Missing Features\|Recommendations" "$file"
done

# Verify templates were used properly
grep -L "TEMPLATE" coverage-reports/*.md | wc -l
# Should be > 0 (templates replaced with real content)
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Completion Criteria**

### **Individual Agent Success:**
- [ ] 3 files created (COVERAGE, IMPROVEMENTS, DIFF)
- [ ] Coverage percentage calculated and reported
- [ ] All checklist features analyzed  
- [ ] Missing features have complete BDD scenarios
- [ ] Implementation guide ready for coding agents

### **Overall Project Success:**
- [ ] 15 total files created (5 agents Ã— 3 files each)
- [ ] All 12 remaining checklist files analyzed
- [ ] Average coverage >= 85% across all checklists
- [ ] Complete implementation roadmap for 95%+ total coverage
- [ ] Ready for coding agent execution phase

---

## ðŸ”„ **Post-Execution Actions**

### **1. Aggregate Results:**
- Compile coverage statistics across all checklists
- Identify highest-priority missing features
- Create master implementation plan

### **2. Update Documentation:**
- Update main CLAUDE.md with completion status
- Add summary statistics to project documentation
- Mark all checklists as âœ… VERIFIED

### **3. Prepare for Implementation:**
- Prioritize BDD improvements by impact
- Prepare coding agent instructions
- Set up validation procedures for BDD updates

This parallel execution plan enables efficient, coordinated coverage verification across all remaining ARGUS WFM checklist files while maintaining quality and consistency.
